It allows God to trust us to do even bigger things! David understood this, and he acted responsibly by leaving the sheep in the care of another shepherd before going to see his brothers on the battlefield. Here are three guidelines from the Bible on family relationships: \"Children, obey your parents because you belong to the Lord, for this is the right thing to do\" (Ephesians 6:1-2a). \"Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger by the way you treat them. Rather, bring them up with the discipline and instruction that comes from the Lord\" (Ephesians 6:4). \"Love each other with genuine affection, and take delight in honoring each other.

'They are plans for good and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope.'\" We read in Genesis 3:8: \"When the cool evening breezes were blowing, the man and his wife heard the Lord God walking about in the garden. So they hid from the Lord God among the trees.\" This is how God wants to relate to us today, as well. It is God's desire to walk with and to communicate with His children. He wants to talk to us. And He wants us to listen and talk to Him. There is more good news: we can hear His voice. The Bible makes it clear that we were created to have two-way communication with Him. Jesus tells us in John 10:27, \"My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me.\" The prophet Isaiah says, \"Your own ears will hear him. Right behind you a voice will say, 'This is the way you should go,' whether to the right or to the left\" (Isaiah 30:21). You can hear God's voice by reading the Bible, through listening to your parents, and by going to church, and listening to your pastor or Sunday School teacher. As you get older, you will learn how to know God's voice from the other voices you may hear. God's voice can come with peace you will feel in your heart. In the Old Testament, a boy named Samuel thought that Eli was speaking to him when it really was God (1 Samuel 3:7-8). He had to learn to identify God's voice. But after some practice, he became one of the greatest prophets in the whole Bible.

By obeying God and doing the right thing -- even if sometimes it doesn't seem like the cool thing to do -- you are actually loving your neighbor.

There is no way for any human being to know what is right and what is wrong unless God reveals it to them. That is why God has given the Bible to us as a guide for living. God's will is expressly revealed in His Word. Hundreds of thousands of people have suffered, sacrificed, been imprisoned, and even died to make sure that you and I received a copy of the Holy Bible. It is foolish to neglect the Scriptures when such a high price has been paid to ensure that we have access to them. Serious study of the Bible will teach us what God expects from us and desires for us in our daily lives. The first thing said about the believers on the day of Pentecost was that, \"They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching\" (Acts 2:42). They were following the principle of Psalm 1 that states, \"Oh, the joys of those who do not follow the advice of the wicked, or stand around with sinners, or join in with mockers.

The blessing of God comes to us despite our weakness, our failures, and our sin. That is why the great hymn writer, John Newton, who himself had been captain of a slave ship, was able to receive God's forgiveness and write these words in his timeless hymn: \"Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me. I once was lost, but now I'm found, was blind, but now I see.\""}]}

What are some ways God speaks to His people?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Jesus said, \"My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me\" (John 10:27). In the book of Romans, the apostle Paul says, \"For all who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God\" (Romans 8:14). The Bible says, \"Your own ears will hear him. Right behind you a voice will say, 'This is the way you should go,' whether to the right or to the left\" (Isaiah 30:21). There are basically seven ways that God speaks to His people today. The first and most important way is through the Scriptures. The Bible is the standard that we use to judge every other form of what we believe to be God's guidance. The second way God communicates is by His Spirit speaking directly to our spirit. This can be through the still small voice that we hear in our heart, through a dream, or through a vision. Because this revelation is supernatural, it's important to confirm that what you believe you are hearing is truly from God. This leads us to the next way God directs, and that is through confirmation. The Bible says, \"The facts of every case must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses\" (2 Corinthians 13:1b). God will speak to us, and then He gives us the other six keys to hearing His voice in order to confirm that what he has said is truly from Him. The next key is godly counsel. The Bible says, \"There is safety in having many advisers\" (Proverbs 11:14b). God is not offended if we seek confirmation through our pastor, our parents, our teachers, or through mature godly friends. In fact, He is blessed when we seek to confirm his guidance in our lives. Another important key to hearing God's voice is through the peace of God. The Bible says, \"You shall go out in joy and be led forth in peace\" (Isaiah 55:12a). It also says, \"Let the peace that comes from Christ rule in your hearts\" (Colossians 3:15a). The word \"rule\" here in the Greek is the same word for an umpire. So the peace of God is like an umpire that tells us whether we are \"safe\" in His will or \"out\" of His will. The next key to hearing God's voice is personal prophecy. God will use New Testament prophets to speak His will to us \" and also to confirm His will in our lives. Scripture says in the book of Amos, \"Indeed, the Sovereign LORD never does anything until he reveals his plans to his servants the prophets\" (Amos 3:7). The apostle Paul tells us that we should be eager to prophesy because God builds up His church through this special gift of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 14:39). But remember, New Testament prophecy is meant for edification, exhortation, and comfort (1 Corinthians 14:3). It is never meant for judgment. The final way that God will speak to us is through circumstances. Some people rely too much on circumstances, neglecting the other six keys of God's guidance. Other people don't pay enough attention to the circumstances and sometimes step out ahead of God's timing, even though they may have actually heard God's voice in a certain direction. So we need to weigh the circumstances along with the other six keys of God's guidance. The wonderful thing to know is that because God loves you He is communicating \" and you can hear His voice and know His will today."}]}

In 2 Corinthians, chapter 5, the apostle Paul uses two metaphors to describe the ministry of Christians in the world. Paul calls us God's ambassadors in the earth (2 Corinthians 5:20). An ambassador is sent by a king or president to a foreign land to represent and declare the will of that ruler. Paul also describes the believer as a minister of reconciliation (2 Corinthians 5:18): \"For God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, no longer counting people's sins against them. And he gave us this wonderful message of reconciliation\" (2 Corinthians 5:19). Every Christian is called to be a minister. Each of us has a special assignment that God wants us to carry out in this life. So you can be a blessing to those around you, in your family, with your friends, and on your job by doing those things that God has created for you to do. You can also be a blessing to those around you by walking in obedience to God and receiving the blessings that come as a result of that obedience. Finally, you can be a blessing by demonstrating the love and grace of God in your daily life. People who don't know God will see His love through your demonstrations of love.>"}]}

In John 14:12, Jesus promised his disciples, \"I tell you the truth, anyone who believes in me will do the same works I have done, and even greater works, because I am going to be with the Father.\" Jesus was explaining that, when He ascended to heaven, He would send the Holy Spirit, who would be our helper and our comforter: \"But when the Father sends the Advocate as my representative--that is, the Holy Spirit--he will teach you everything and will remind you of everything I have told you\" (John 14:26). Jesus told his disciples, \"And now I will send the Holy Spirit, just as my Father promised. But stay here in the city until the Holy Spirit comes and fills you with power from heaven\" (Luke 24:49). Then just before He ascended into heaven, He told His followers: \"But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. And you will be my witnesses, telling people about me everywhere--in Jerusalem, throughout Judea, in Samaria, and to the ends of the earth\" (Acts 1:8). It wasn't until Jesus was baptized in water and the Holy Spirit descended upon Him that Jesus began doing miracles while He was on earth. In the same way, God wants to use every believer to show His power and glory on the earth. In order to move in the power of God, we must not only receive the Holy Spirit in our hearts at salvation, but we also must receive the fullness of the Holy Spirit in a baptism of power \" just like Jesus did at His water baptism. When we yield to God in this manner, He fills us to overflowing with his Holy Spirit, which gives us power to be His witnesses. The word Christian literally means \"Christ-ones.\" God has called each one of us to be like Jesus. We are not Christ, but through the power of the Holy Spirit, we can do the things that Jesus did, as His Holy Spirit directs us. A good way to understand it is to think how the sun is different from the moon. God is like the sun in that He sends forth His light and power into the universe. We are like the moon in that we are an inanimate object that can't give anything of value by ourselves. However, when we receive the light and power from the sun, we can reflect that light into the darkness of this world. Then, people will see the light of Jesus as they look at us. As someone once said, \"We are happy to be the moon!\""}]}

He is our strongest supporter! Even if we mess up or fall short, He will not abandon us! Deuteronomy 7:9 says, \"Understand, therefore, that the Lord your God is indeed God. He is the faithful God who keeps his covenant for a thousand generations and lavishes his unfailing love on those who love him and obey his commands.\" He has kept His promises to His people since He created the earth. We can trust His promises and His unfailing love today, tomorrow, and forever! Ruth was an excellent example of being kind and loyal. She stuck with Naomi in good times and bad times. She also remained loyal to God and did not go back to her false gods when given the chance. Ruth 1:16-18 says, \"But Ruth replied, \"Don't ask me to leave you and turn back. Wherever you go, I will go; wherever you live, I will live. Your people will be my people, and your God will be my God. Wherever you die, I will die, and there I will be buried. May the Lord punish me severely if I allow anything but death to separate us!\" When Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her, she said nothing more.\" Ruth remained loyal to Ruth by words and actions. She volunteered to work in Boaz's fields to provide food for them. This she did faithfully and remained with Naomi. (Ruth 2:23). Loyalty is more than words; it is validated by actions. Before Jesus was arrested and crucified, Peter and the other disciples vowed they would not deny Jesus, even if it meant dying with Him. The Bible tells us that Peter did deny Jesus three times as Jesus had predicted. The other disciples ran away and were scattered. Peter and the others meant well, but fear kept them from backing up their words. (Matthew 26:31-35; Mark 14:50, 66-72). Loyalty is a valuable and rare trait to have. It is worth pursuing in our relationships with both God and others. \"Many will say they are loyal friends, but who can find one who is truly reliable?\" (Proverbs 20:6). The Bible also tells us in Proverbs 3:3 how important kindness and loyalty are: \"Never let loyalty and kindness leave you! Tie them around your neck as a reminder.

In the book of Ruth we see Boaz as an example of the kinsman redeemer, which is what Jesus became for all mankind through His death and resurrection. So, we see Jesus in the compassion and redemptive act of Boaz toward Naomi and Ruth. (Ruth 4:1-10; Titus 2:14). We also see the bloodline through which Jesus would be born. Boaz acted as the kinsman-redeemer to Ruth; they married and had a child named Obed. He became the father to Jesse, and he became the father to King David. Jesus Christ descended from this royal bloodline. As a descendent of Boaz and Ruth, Jesus is the promised son of David who sits forever on the throne of Israel. (Ruth 4:17-22). Yes, Boaz purchased back, or redeemed Naomi's property for her. She was no longer poor and without hope. She was now under the protection and provision of Boaz. This was God's plan to restore the joy to Naomi and Ruth for their faithfulness and trust in Him. God also has a plan of redemption working in our lives -- and through our lives. \"Yet God, in his grace, freely makes us right in his sight. He did this through Christ Jesus when he freed us from the penalty for our sins.\" (Romans 3:24). We were without hope, slaves to sin, unable to pay the price for our sin.

In the ten years she was married to Ruth's son, she had experienced the goodness of the one true, living God! She was committed to being a child of God and living among His people! Naomi knew Ruth was in it for life! (Ruth 1:1-18). After Jesus' death, Peter and other disciples went back to the Sea of Galilee. They were heartbroken, confused, and scared. Jesus was gone! They tried to go back to what they knew and did before they met Jesus. Jesus came to them as they fished on the Sea of Galilee. Once Peter realized that it was Jesus on the shore, he immediately jumped into the water and swam to Him. The old life paled in comparison to the new life he had begun with Jesus! He couldn't return to his former life. (John 21). Sometimes our old way of life may look attractive to us again. This is especially true in difficult times like temptations, trials, or peer pressure. Elijah confronted God's people who were trying to worship both God and idols. He told them to quit going back and forth and to choose who they would serve! (1 Kings 18:21). When Joshua led God's people into the Promised Land, he called them to serve God wholeheartedly and to put away their idols. Then he boldly declared that he and his family had committed to serve the Lord! He did not wait for the others to make their decision. This was his choice regardless. (Joshua 2:14-15). This was like Ruth; she was not swayed by Orpah's decision to return to her former life. Paul said this about His pursuit of righteousness in God: \"No, dear brothers and sisters, I have not achieved it, but I focus on this one thing: Forgetting the past and looking forward to what lies ahead.\" (Philippians 3:13). Paul refused to look back! Psalm 34:8 says, \"Taste and see that the Lord is good.

The Bible tells us, \"If we confess our sins to him, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all wickedness\" (1 John 1:9). From the beginning, God wanted a family. He wants to have a relationship with you like a father does with his son. Sometimes we hurt our father. But we want to quickly apologize and make things right. It's the same with our Heavenly Father. The only way we can know what is right or wrong in this world is by what He has revealed to us through his Word. We also are able to know if we have done wrong through the conviction of the Holy Spirit in our hearts. In the book of Jeremiah, God said that he would make a new covenant with us and that he would write his law upon our hearts. When we sin or do something that God doesn't want us to do, we can feel a sense of guilt or sadness because his Holy Spirit is at work in our hearts. So if we do something that is wrong, we need to say we're sorry for that to our Heavenly Father. Then we need to make a decision not to do that thing anymore. If we have trouble committing that sin over and over again, we may need to ask God to give us the grace and the strength to overcome that sin. We may also need to find someone like our parents or a pastor who can help us by being a friend that we can share our challenges with. You should always ask your parents who would be a person that you can trust to share these things. Another way that we can overcome sin is by spending time with on God's word (2 Timothy 2:15). King David said, \"I have hidden your word in my heart, that I might not sin against you\" (Psalm 119:11). The word of God is powerful (Hebrews 4:12) and as we think on it are it starts to impact how we think and what we will desire to do in our lives. This is called renewing our mind according to the word of God (Romans 12:2). God's powerful Word will actually start to change the way we think and change the things that we want to do or don't want to do. Another way to overcome sin is to spend time with God in prayer and in praise and worship. This builds up our relationship with the Lord and our affection for him. Over time, we fall so much in love with God that we don't want to do anything that will hurt Him. God wants you to walk in victory and not face the sin (Romans 6:23). So take the time to read His word, then spend time in prayer and worship with the Lord, and soon you will see that those things that used to cause you to sin become less and less a part of your life. You will gain the victory as you walk with Jesus."}]}

Because we are human, we all make mistakes and sin from time to time (Romans 3:23). You need to understand that this sin makes God sad, but He is not angry with you. God is sad because he knows that sin can harm you (Romans 6:23), and He does not want any harm to come to you. So when we sin, it is important that we quickly ask God to forgive us (1 John 1:9) and to cleanse us from all of our sins, both the ones we remember and even the ones we may have forgotten about. Saying we're sorry to God for our sins is called repentance. The word \"repent\" in the Greek literally means to \"change your mind.\" So when we repent for our sins, we are saying sorry to God, and we are promising that, by His grace and with His help, we will not do bad things anymore. But even if we sin again, we need to understand that God loves us. He's our Heavenly Father, and He wants us to ask for forgiveness so that He can bless us and protect us from any plans of the devil. God's love and forgiveness for us through Jesus sacrifice on the cross is one of the reasons why the Gospel is such Good News."}]}

He was angry with his younger brother because he left. The older brother had the right heart. But he also had spiritual pride. This brother obeyed the law. But he did not have the same love that his father had, and this was his weakness. As Christians, it can be very easy for us to fall into the same trap of spiritual pride that the older brother fell into. We can say, \"Oh I love God, but I don't like people very much.\" But this shows a lack of maturity and a lack of understanding of what God desires for us in this life (1 John 4:20). The Apostle John said that Jesus came in grace and truth (John 1:17). This is significant language because it shows that, with Jesus, grace was first and truth was secondary. Some Christians make the mistake of upholding truth without walking in grace and love. The Bible says, \"Speak the truth in love\" (Ephesians 4:15). In the importance chapter on love, 1 Corinthians 13, the apostle Paul says, \"If I could speak all the languages of earth and of angels, but didn't love others, I would only be a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. If I had the gift of prophecy, and if I understood all of God's secret plans and possessed all knowledge, and if I had such faith that I could move mountains, but didn't love others, I would be nothing\" (1 Corinthians 13:1-2). The older brother understood and obeyed the law, but he did not understand the importance of love. As the father pointed out, this son who once was dead but now was alive (Luke 15:32). He had come back to his father, and that's all that mattered. We need to make sure that we are not judging those who have been disobedient to our Heavenly Father, but instead we need to show the love and grace of God to these people who are often hurting inside. The Bible tells us, \"Love never fails\" (1 Corinthians 13:8) The father in the parable of the prodigal son had true love; when his rebellious son came home. he ran to meet him (Luke 15:20). Let's show the same kind of love to those in our lives who need to see their Heavenly Father and know his grace and his mercy."}]}

He gave the Israelites the Ten Commandments, which begins with: \"I am the Lord your God, who rescued you from the land of Egypt, the place of your slavery. You must not have any other god but Me\" (Ex. 20:2-3). King Ahab and his wife, Jezebel promoted the worship of false gods. In reality, there is only one God; every other god is a false God. Here is what the apostle Paul wrote on this subject in 1 Corinthians 8:4b-6: \"Well, we all know that an idol is not really a god and that there is only one God. There may be so-called gods both in heaven and on earth, and some people actually worship many gods and many lords. But we know that there is only one God, the Father, who created everything, and we live for Him. And there is only one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom God made everything and through whom we have been given life.\" Yes, every other so-called god is man-made. There is only one God Who created all that we see from nothing! He is the source of life and He gives us the very breath that we breathe! The apostle Paul in Acts 17: 23-25 was dealing with people who worshiped many other gods. One of their gods didn't even have a name! Paul talked to them about the one true God, the creator of life. \"For as I was walking along I saw your many shrines. And one of your altars had this inscription on it: 'To an Unknown God.' This God, whom you worship without knowing, is the one I'm telling you about. He is the God who made the world and everything in it. Since He is Lord of heaven and earth, He doesn't live in man-made temples, and human hands can't serve His needs for He has no needs. He himself gives life and breath to everything, and He satisfies every need.\" God does not want to share our worship with any false god! On Mount Carmel, the false prophets prayed to their idols which were silent. Their idols were not real and they could not receive or respond to the worship of the prophets. God immediately responded to Elijah's prayer on Mount Carmel to prove that God was the one true God of Israel! He sent fire from heaven that burnt up the altar. The people were now convinced that God was the only God. (1 Kings 18:20-38). \"And when all the people saw it, they fell face down on the ground and cried out, \"The Lord He is God! Yes, the Lord is God!\" (1 Kings 18:39). Yes, there is only one God and only He is worthy of our worship and praise!"}]}

King Ahab refused to acknowledge that his sin had provoked the anger of God. Instead he blamed Elijah for the drought and all of the trouble that Israel experienced because of it. \"When Ahab saw him, he exclaimed, \"So, is it really you, you troublemaker of Israel?\" I have made no trouble for Israel,\" Elijah replied. \"You and your family are the troublemakers, for you have refused to obey the commands of the Lord and have worshiped the images of Baal instead.\" (1 Kings 18: 17-18). Sometime later, Jezebel had an innocent man named Naboth killed so Ahab could take ownership of his property. Though it seemed like Ahab and Jezebel had gotten away with many evil, wicked deeds, it was soon time to reap what they had sown. God sent Elijah to tell him that God was about to punish not only him, but his family too \" including Jezebel! They would all experience painful deaths. Elijah's prophecy of God's judgment came true. (1 Kings 21:17-22; 1 Kings 22:32-38; 2 Kings 9:30-37). Elijah was weary from doing good and constantly facing those who chose to do evil. At times, it may seem like we are the only ones serving God! This is how it seemed to Elijah who told God that he was the only prophet left! God told Elijah there were 7,000 others who served Him that had never bowed down to Baal. God knows all those who serve Him and are obedient to His Word. He also sees those who choose to do evil and rebel against Him. (1 Kings 19:10-18). Like Elijah, it is easy to become weary of doing good when we are surrounded by evil. God's angels ministered to and strengthened Elijah. We also need to spend time in God's presence to renew our strength. Galatians 6:7-9 says, \"Don't be misled you cannot mock the justice of God. You will always harvest what you plant. Those who live only to satisfy their own sinful nature will harvest decay and death from that sinful nature. But those who live to please the Spirit will harvest everlasting life from the Spirit. So let's not get tired of doing what is good. At just the right time we will reap a harvest of blessing if we don't give up.\" Everyone will reap what they have sown whether it is evil or good! This is not the time to give up; there is a harvest of blessing coming to those who sow righteousness!"}]}

Jezebel was furious that Elijah had killed her prophets, and she vowed to kill him. In fear, Elijah ran into the wilderness, sat under a tree, exhausted and depleted, he asked God to take his life. Instead, God sent an angel to feed and strengthen Elijah. He then traveled for 40 days and 40 nights to Mount Sinai by God's strength. God spoke to him in different ways as Elijah stood in a cave. Then God sent Elijah to Damascus to anoint two kings. Elijah then was sent to train Elisha, and anointed him to succeed Elijah as a prophet. (1 Kings 19:1-21). Elijah had been ready to throw in the towel in his own strength and will. Instead, he was renewed and refreshed by spending time in God's presence to continue to do God's will. We are no different than Elijah. We have our ups and downs, our strong and weak times. Some days we feel like there is nothing we can't do; the next day we may feel like we can't do anything! The answer is to spend time in God's presence; in praise and worship, reading His Word, praying, and simply waiting on Him. Isaiah 40:31 says: \"But those who trust in the Lord will find new strength. They will soar high on wings like eagles. They will run and not grow weary. They will walk and not faint.\" Jesus demonstrated the need to be alone with God to renew His strength while He was a man on this earth. \"But despite Jesus' instructions, the report of His power spread even faster, and vast crowds came to hear Him preach and to be healed of their diseases. But Jesus often withdrew to the wilderness for prayer.\" (Luke 5:15-16). Because Jesus experienced human weakness, He is able to help us when we are weak. Hebrews 4:15 says, \"This High Priest of ours understands our weaknesses, for He faced all of the same testings we do, yet He did not sin.\" Isn't that amazing? What hope and encouragement that should give us! Jesus faced all of the same things we face and He was victorious every time. He was without sin! He felt every weakness we will ever experience. Now He is in heaven as our High Priest interceding for us and standing by to help us have the victory over any type of weakness. Whenever we feel weak and are ready to give up, remember this verse: \"He gives power to the weak and strength to the powerless.\" (Isaiah 40:29)."}]}

When Elijah asked them to choose who they would follow, Baal or the one true God, they were silent. Did they really not know the truth? The Bible tells us that there are many false prophets in this world. 1 John 4:1-2 says: \"Dear friends, do not believe everyone who claims to speak by the Spirit. You must test them to see if the spirit they have comes from God. For there are many false prophets in the world. By this you know the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God.\" We are told to test every spirit. To do this we need the Holy Spirit to help us discern truth from falsehood. The good news is that the Holy Spirit lives inside every born again believer of Jesus. He can help us no matter where we are or what we are doing. Jesus sent Him to lead us into all truth! \"When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all truth. He will not speak on his own but will tell you what he has heard. He will tell you about the future.\" (John 16:13). We also are to determine if words spoken or taught agree with God's Word. If not, we must reject those words! The Bible says this about prophecies, \"But test everything that is said. Hold on to what is good. Stay away from every kind of evil.\" (1 Thessalonians 5:21-22). Thankfully, we have the power and wisdom of the Holy Spirit in us. We must allow the Spirit of truth to speak to us before we accept something as God's truth."}]}

(1 Kings 16:29-33). His idolatry influenced the people of Israel. They also strayed from serving only God. Elijah boldly stood up and challenged the Israelites to make a decision to serve Baal or to serve God. \"Then Elijah stood in front of them and said, \"How much longer will you waver, hobbling between two opinions? If the Lord is God, follow Him! But if Baal is God, then follow him!\" But the people were completely silent.\" (1 Kings 18:21). It is hard to believe that the Israelites would not commit to following God; yet they did not respond! This is nothing new for God's people. Years before when the Israelites entered the Promised Land, Joshua issued a similar challenge to God's people. \"So fear the Lord and serve Him wholeheartedly. Put away forever the idols your ancestors worshiped when they lived beyond the Euphrates River and in Egypt. Serve the Lord alone. But if you refuse to serve the Lord, then choose today whom you will serve. Would you prefer the gods your ancestors served beyond the Euphrates? Or will it be the gods of the Amorites in whose land you now live? But as for me and my family, we will serve the Lord.\" (Joshua 24:15). Did you notice that Joshua had already made his decision? He did not wait to see who the majority chose to serve! He chose to serve God! This is important for us to understand. We must all make a choice. There is no middle ground. We cannot straddle the fence; one day serving God if it is convenient, and one day following the ways of the world. The leaders of God's people time and time again called the people to renew their covenant, or promise, to God to serve and obey His commandments. When we choose God, each day we must dedicate ourselves to serving Him and obeying His Word. The apostle Paul wrote this to God's people to challenge them to live for God and not for the world. \"And so, dear brothers and sisters, I plead with you to give your bodies to God because of all He has done for you. Let them be a living and holy sacrifice the kind He will find acceptable. This is truly the way to worship Him. Don't copy the behavior and customs of this world, but let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think. Then you will learn to know God's will for you, which is good and pleasing and perfect.\" (Romans 12:1-2)"}]}

The Pharisees were trying once again to trap Jesus by asking questions of Him. An expert in religious law asked Jesus what the most important commandments was. \"Jesus replied, \"'You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your mind.' This is the first and greatest commandment. A second is equally important: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' The entire law and all the demands of the prophets are based on these two commandments.\" (Matthew 22:37-40) According to Jesus' answer- loving our neighbor is very important! You have probably heard of the Golden Rule. Jesus said it in Matthew 7:12. \"Do to others whatever you would like them to do to you. This is the essence of all that is taught in the law and the prophets. (Matthew 7:12). How would you like to be treated? Treat others that way. Would you like mercy? Show mercy to others. Would you like to be forgiven? Forgive others. This is how we love our neighbor as ourselves!"}]}

What does it even mean to be generous? It means to freely and willingly give or share all or more than is needed or required. The Samaritan in Jesus' parable was both kind and generous. He risked his own life by stopping to help the injured man. The bandits could have been hiding and waiting for someone to stop to help so they could attack again. Then he used his own oil, wine, and bandages to care for the man's wounds. He placed the man on his own donkey and brought him to the inn. He wasn't done yet! He paid the innkeeper what amounted to about two day's wages at that time. The next day, he promised to pay the innkeeper for any additional expenses needed to care for the man until he was well! What an example Jesus gave to us of generously caring for our neighbor. What the Samaritan did was for a friend or fellow Samaritan; yet, he did all of this for his despised Jewish enemy! (Luke 10:25-37). Are we generous like the Samaritan? Or, do we try to give the least amount of time, effort, or money to a need or request? What is our attitude when we give or help? Are we cheerful and eager to give? Or, do we do it grudgingly and complain as we do it? 2 Corinthians 9:7-9 says, \"You must each decide in your heart how much to give. And don't give reluctantly or in response to pressure. \"For God loves a person who gives cheerfully.\" And God will generously provide all you need. Then you will always have everything you need and plenty left over to share with others. As the Scriptures say, \"They share freely and give generously to the poor. Their good deeds will be remembered forever.\" God's response to our generosity is to be generous with us! He will give us all we need and even more to share with others! We love and serve a generous God. How generous? He sent His only Son to die for our sin so that we might live with Him forever! When we are connected to Christ, God generously blesses our lives. \"All praise to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms because we are united with Christ.\" (Ephesians 1:3)."}]}

The man replied, \"The one who showed him mercy.\" Then Jesus said, \"Yes, now go and do the same.\" (Luke 10:36-37). It is interesting that the scribe would not say it was the Samaritan. He said \"the one who showed mercy\". It must have been very difficult to hear Jesus' parable. No doubt the scribe had his own ideas of who his neighbors were. The Samaritans were not on the list! Jesus told the scribe to go show mercy to others; not just his friends, or fellow leaders \" everyone. The words of Jesus are spoken to us too! We must also show mercy. So, what does it mean to show mercy? It means to show others loving-kindness and compassion; to show pity and be ready to help someone who is in trouble. Doesn't that describe the Samaritan actions? This is how Jesus represented mercy in the parable. Before Jesus told his parable, two of Jesus' disciples didn't want to show mercy to their neighbors, the Samaritans! They asked Jesus if they should send fire from heaven to destroy the Samaritan village! All because they didn't welcome Jesus! Jesus sternly rebuked them! (Luke 9: 51-56) What do you long for when you mess up or sin; mercy, right? The good news for us is that God is the source of mercy! \"So let us come boldly to the throne of our gracious God. There we will receive his mercy, and we will find grace to help us when we need it most.\" (Hebrews 4:16). That's a relief!

The scribes and other religious leaders of Jesus' day appeared on the outside to obey God in word and deed. Yet, Jesus saw their heart and motives on the inside. He saw who they really were and He had harsh words for them. Matthew 23:27:28 says, \"What sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you Pharisees. Hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs beautiful on the outside but filled on the inside with dead people's bones and all sorts of impurity. Outwardly you look like righteous people, but inwardly your hearts are filled with hypocrisy and lawlessness.\" Imagine the surprise and embarrassment when the scribe heard Jesus' parable. Instead of validating him, Jesus pointed out the Samaritan as a true neighbor rather than the Jewish priest or the Temple assistant (Luke 10:25-37). God often rebuked the religious leaders of His day because they were hypocrites. They liked to put on a show for others rather than live a life filled with truth and love. God has always placed more importance on the inside versus the outside of a person. We see this when the prophet Samuel went to anoint one of Jesse's sons as king. 1 Samuel 16:7 says, \"But the Lord said to Samuel, \"Don't judge by his appearance or height, for I have rejected him. The Lord doesn't see things the way you see them. People judge by outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.\" Yes, God looks at the inner man; beyond what we can see with our physical eyes. Later in King David's life he had committed sins against Uriah, one of his officers. He committed adultery with Uriah's wife and then had Uriah sent to the front lines in battle so he would be killed. (2 Samuel 11:15; 2 Samuel 12:1-13). David had fooled everyone. He had literally gotten away with murder! Yet, He had not fooled God. God sent the prophet Nathan to expose David's sin. David then pleaded with God to forgive him and restore him. He asked God to cleanse him and purify his heart and his inward parts (Hebrew wording). (Psalm 51:1-3; 6-10). Let us be more concerned about being pure inside than impressing or fooling others on the outside! Let us pray daily that the Holy Spirit would cleanse and purify our hearts!"}]}

Jesus responded that soon it would not matter where God was worshiped. He wanted all people to worship Him in spirit and in truth. This pointed to a time when the Holy Spirit would fill and dwell in all believers after Jesus' death, resurrection, and return to heaven. (John 4:21-24). But, before anyone can worship in spirit and truth, they must hear the Gospel of Jesus Christ! In Acts 1:8, Jesus proclaimed that believers would be filled with the Spirit to give them power to take the Gospel everywhere on the earth. This included Samaria! \"But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. And you will be my witnesses, telling people about me everywhere in Jerusalem, throughout Judea, in Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.\" By the power of God's Spirit, a man named Philip preached to the Samaritans who believed and were saved. He performed many miracles there. The apostles in Jerusalem heard what was happening in Samaria and came to lay hands on the people so they could be filled with the Holy Spirit! On the way back to Jerusalem they preached the Gospel in Samaritan villages along the way. (Acts 8:4-25). Yes, the Gospel was and is for everyone, both Jews and Gentiles alike.

The writer of Hebrews tells us that we can train our ear to recognize the voice of God above all the noise. \"But solid food belongs to those who are of full age, that is, those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil\" (Hebrews 5:14). It is by practicing, by reason of use, that we are able to discern whether what we hear is of God, our flesh, or the Devil. Isaiah 30:21 says, \"Your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, \"This is the way, walk in it,\" Whenever you turn to the right hand or whenever you turn to the left.\" So God will speak, and you can hear His voice, but you must be careful -- especially when you are a young Christian -- that you objectively confirm that you are following the Holy Spirit and not another voice. Our own flesh can scream pretty loud (especially when we are under pressure, or we want something very badly). And the Devil is the father of lies -- he is the great deceiver. The bottom line is that big decisions require a lot of prayer.

Perhaps the LORD will punish you for what you are trying to do to me, but I will never harm you.\" (1 Samuel 24:12). Saul was amazed. \"And he said to David, \"You are a better man than I am, for you have repaid me good for evil.\" (1 Samuel 24:17). David had great respect and honor for King Saul because God's anointing was on him. God does not want us to repay evil with good. In fact, we are to do the opposite! \"Don't repay evil for evil. Don't retaliate with insults when people insult you. Instead, pay them back with a blessing. That is what God has called you to do, and he will bless you for it.\" (1 Peter 3:9) Leaving revenge in God's hands is not always easy. Yet, when we do, God takes notice and rewards us. Romans 12:19 says, \"Dear friends, never take revenge. Leave that to the righteous anger of God. For the Scriptures say, \"I will take revenge; I will pay them back,\" says the Lord.\" Our best example of repaying evil with good comes from Jesus. While hanging from the cross, Jesus didn't ask God to punish those who were crucifying Him; instead He ask God to forgive them! (Luke 23:34)."}]}

As Saul was leaving to go home, Samuel told him that God's Spirit would come upon him and change him. \"At that time the Spirit of the Lord will come powerfully upon you, and you will prophesy with them. You will be changed into a different person.\" This is exactly what happened. \"When Saul and his servant arrived at Gibeah, they saw a group of prophets coming toward them. Then the Spirit of God came powerfully upon Saul, and he, too, began to prophesy.\" Soon after Saul became king, the Spirit came upon Saul again and empowered him to lead the Israelites to victory against their enemy, the Ammonites (1 Samuel 10:6,10; 1 Samuel 11:6). After God rejected Saul as king, Samuel anointed David to be King of Israel. The Spirit then came upon David powerfully. \"So as David stood there among his brothers, Samuel took the flask of olive oil he had brought and anointed David with the oil. And the Spirit of the LORD came powerfully upon David from that day on. Then Samuel returned to Ramah.\" (1 Samuel 16:13) To anoint means to cover with oil. Oil is a symbol of the Holy Spirit. There are many examples in the Old Testament where God's Spirit coming powerfully upon His people to anoint them for mighty works. So, what about us today; does the Spirit come upon us in the same way? This is the exciting part! When Jesus returned to heaven, God sent a gift to all believers. He sent the Holy Spirit to fill us! Today, God's Spirit doesn't just come upon us; He actually lives in us! (1 John 2:27; 1 Corinthians 3:16). This means that we can experience God's power and anointing continually each day!"}]}

He had God's Spirit and favor upon on him. Yet, Saul became jealous of David's ability, success, and popularity with God's people. \"When the victorious Israelite army was returning home after David had killed the Philistine, women from all the towns of Israel came out to meet King Saul. They sang and danced for joy with tambourines and cymbals.This was their song: \"Saul has killed his thousands, and David his ten thousands!\" This made Saul very angry. \"What's this?\" he said. \"They credit David with ten thousands and me with only thousands. Next they'll be making him their king!\" So from that time on Saul kept a jealous eye on David.\" (1 Samuel 18:6-9). Instead of asking for His help, Saul allowed the jealousy to grow in his heart. This led to disobedience and other sinful acts. This is exactly what the Bible warns us about. \"For wherever there is jealousy and selfish ambition, there you will find disorder and evil of every kind.\" (James 3:16). So how should we respond to other's possessions or success instead of being filled with jealousy? 1 Thessalonians 5:13 says, \"Be thankful in all circumstances, for this is God's will for you who belong to Christ Jesus.\" Instead of being jealous, God wants us to be thankful for other's blessings. Psalm 103:2 says, \"Let all that I am praise the LORD; may I never forget the good things he does for me.\" Instead of focusing on what others have, praise God for what He has given you! Yes, jealousy is dangerous and leads to other sin. We must guard our hearts and fill them with thanksgiving, not jealousy. \"Anger is cruel, and wrath is like a flood, but jealousy is even more dangerous.\" (Proverbs 27:4)"}]}

Then he shouted to Saul, \"Why do you listen to the people who say I am trying to harm you? This very day you can see with your own eyes it isn't true. For the LORD placed you at my mercy back there in the cave. Some of my men told me to kill you, but I spared you. For I said, 'I will never harm the king he is the Lord's anointed one.' (1 Samuel 24:8-10) David greeted Saul as his lord the king. This is difficult to understand after all David had been through. Just minutes before, David had been given the opportunity to kill Saul. His men even encouraged him to do it Yet, David still saw himself as a servant to his king - the Lord's anointed one! Romans 13:1 says, \"Everyone must submit to governing authorities. For all authority comes from God, and those in positions of authority have been placed there by God.\" Let David be our example of honoring leaders.

This was far from the truth. God's orders were to completely destroy the evil Amalekites who had opposed the Israelites when they left Egypt. Instead, Saul chose to spare the king's life, and keep the best animals, and valuable objects for himself. He only destroyed what was worthless (1 Samuel 15:8-9). Samuel confronted Saul with his sin. Saul denied that He had done anything wrong. He told Samuel that he completed the mission God gave him. \"But I did obey the LORD,\" Saul insisted. \"I carried out the mission he gave me. I brought back King Agag, but I destroyed everyone else. Then my troops brought in the best of the sheep, goats, cattle, and plunder to sacrifice to the LORD your God in Gilgal.\" (1 Samuel 15:20-21). Sin cannot be hidden from God. Because Saul continued to disobey God and would not repent, God rejected Saul and removed his kingdom from him. God will not be mocked! 1 John 1:8-9 says, \"If we claim we have no sin, we are only fooling ourselves and not living in the truth. But if we confess our sins to him, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all wickedness.\" When we make excuses for our sin, we fool ourselves, not God. If we will confess our sins - if we admit that we have sinned and have offended God - He will forgive us and cleanse us! God sent the prophet Nathan to King David to reveal David's secret sin. David had successfully hidden his sin from others, but God knew! When Nathan revealed the sin to David, David was heartbroken and repented of his sin. He asked God for His mercy and forgiveness. \"Have mercy on me, O God, because of your unfailing love. Because of your great compassion, blot out the stain of my sins. Wash me clean from my guilt. Purify me from my sin. For I recognize my rebellion; it haunts me day and night. Against you, and you alone, have I sinned; I have done what is evil in your sight. You will be proved right in what you say, and your judgment against me is just.\" (Psalm 51:1-4). This is the correct response to sin. It is right to apologize to others we have sinned against, but don't forget that God has been offended and sinned against too! David recognized and understood how he had fallen short of God's Word. In contrast, Saul didn't make the connection; he was in denial and fooling himself. We must never try to hide our sin. Always come to God and confess your sin; repent and ask God to cleanse and forgive you! He is faithful to do it every time!"}]}

Elisha remained loyal to God and his calling throughout his ministry. It is still important today to be loyal and faithful to God. These are also important traits to have as a friend too. It is easy to be a friend in good times, but how about in difficult times? What if others turn against them, will you stay by their side? The Bible tells us that a loyal friend is not easy to find. \"Many will say they are loyal friends, but who can find one who is truly reliable?\" (Proverbs 20:6). Elijah must have been relieved and comforted knowing that when he left the earth, Elisha would faithfully continue to do God's work. The Bible tells us that there are great rewards for those who are loyal. \"Never let loyalty and kindness leave you! Tie them around your neck as a reminder. Write them deep within your heart.

Lazarus was Jesus' dear friend. Jesus immediately stopped what He was doing to rush to his friends that He loved, right? No, Jesus chose to wait two more days before going to see them. Why would Jesus wait? John 11:4 says, \"But when Jesus heard about it He said, \"Lazarus's sickness will not end in death. No, it happened for the glory of God so that the Son of God will receive glory from this.\" There was a greater purpose to Lazarus' sickness, one that would bring glory to Jesus and God. Jesus knew that He would raise Lazarus from the dead; it didn't matter how many days had passed! Many people would believe in Jesus because of it! Jesus also knew that by waiting, even His own disciples' faith would be strengthened. (John 11:1-6, 14-15; 12:9-11). When Jesus arrived in Bethany, Lazarus had been dead for four days. Jesus told Martha that her brother would live again, and that is exactly what happened! Jesus told the people to roll the stone away from Lazarus' tomb. He then called for Lazarus to come out. He walked out of the tomb; Lazarus was alive! The people had thought Jesus was too late. He wasn't late - His timing was perfect! God's timing is not always the same as ours. He accomplished more things by not rushing to heal Lazarus when he was sick. It isn't easy to wait on the Lord; we want an answer - now! When we do trust and patiently wait on Him, we have a promise in Isaiah 40:31: \"But those who trust in the Lord will find new strength. They will soar high on wings like eagles. They will run and not grow weary. They will walk and not faint.\" God knows exactly what is going on at all times in our lives. Jesus wasn't surprised by Lazarus' sickness and death. He knew even before He received the message from Mary and Martha. He already had a plan for God's greater glory and would not hurried by others. Don't panic when it seems God is moving too slow or not according to your schedule! \"But you must not forget this one thing, dear friends: A day is like a thousand years to the Lord, and a thousand years is like a day (2 Peter 3:8). God does not look at time like we do. Yes, wait on the Lord, trust in His timing and greater purpose; His timing is always perfect!"}]}

But, instead of serving Jesus, she placed more importance on sitting at Jesus' feet to listen to Him teach. Martha was not happy and thought that Mary needed to get her priorities in order. In fact, Martha was so upset that she asked Jesus to tell Mary to get up and help her! Jesus had to agree that it was unfair for Mary to let Martha do all the work, right? Instead, Jesus told Mary to not be so worried about the meal. He said there was only one thing to be concerned about and Mary had made the right choice \" spending time listening to His words! That wasn't what Martha expected to hear! Mary hadn't made the wrong choice; Martha had! (Mark 10:38-42). Yes, we are to serve. Jesus set the example to serve one another and to serve God. Yet, Jesus also placed a priority on getting away from the crowds of people and spending time with God. In these times, He could speak and listen to His Father. He could be strengthened to do God's will. Service and busyness never replace personal time with God. The things of this world will not last, but the Word that God places in our heart can never be taken away from us! Sometimes busyness, even with good things, can interfere with our relationship with Jesus. It is important to keep balance in our lives between serving and sitting in God's presence. We must listen to the Holy Spirit inside us. If He is leading us to rest, pray, listen, or read God's Word \" we need to make the right choice as Mary did. \"There is only one thing worth being concerned about.

Martha also revealed that she believed Jesus was the Messiah, the Son of God, Who was sent to earth by God. Mary, Martha's sister, voiced the same faith in Jesus' healing ability. \"When Mary arrived and saw Jesus, she fell at his feet and said, \"Lord, if only you had been here, my brother would not have died.\" (John 11:32). Both women believed Jesus could heal but not that He could raise Lazarus from the dead. Martha protested when Jesus told the people to roll aside the stone from Lazarus' tomb. Surely Lazarus body had begun to decompose and stink; certainly it was too late! Martha and Mary's faith was about to grow! Imagine their amazement and joy seeing Lazarus walk out of His tomb! (John 11:17-44). Yes, Jesus heals the living and gives life to the dead! Just like with Mary and Martha, Jesus honors the faith that we have. One time in the Bible, Jesus' disciples were unable to cast a demon out of a boy that was brought to them by his father. The disciples could not do it and asked Jesus why they were not successful. \"You don't have enough faith,\" Jesus told them. \"I tell you the truth, if you had faith even as small as a mustard seed, you could say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it would move. Nothing would be impossible.\" As we read and discover more about Jesus, our small faith will grow larger. We will begin to trust God for greater and greater things.

(John 8:58; John 1:14; Philippians 2:6-7; Hebrews 2:17-18). As a man, Jesus didn't just see the pain and the sorrow of Martha and Mary, He felt it too! Jesus was deeply touched and troubled by everything that was happening. He wept at the loss of His dear friend. \"Wept\" in this verse means to burst into tears! (John 11:30-35). When we feel grief, sorrow, or pain, Jesus has experienced it. He comes to comfort us and give us peace. Paul wrote a letter to the church at Corinth. He talked about the comfort God brings through Christ. \"May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace. All praise to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

If he did this, Solomon would be successful in all he did. We read that Solomon loved the Lord and followed all the decrees of his father David. (1 Kings 2:1-3). Solomon was successful because of his obedience. He had more wisdom and wealth than any king on earth because of God's blessings upon his life. (1 Kings 3: 12-13). It is important for us to honor our parents; so important that God made it one of the Ten Commandments. Ephesians 6:1-3 says, \"Children, obey your parents because you belong to the Lord, for this is the right thing to do. \"Honor your father and mother.\" This is the first commandment with a promise: If you honor your father and mother, \"things will go well for you, and you will have a long life on the earth.\" As believers in Jesus, we belong to the Lord and must show honor to our parents. How do we do this? To honor someone means not only to obey, but also to show respect with our actions and words. To honor in a way that pleases the Lord, we must not only obey but also do it with a right attitude and heart. That means without grumbling and complaining! The Greek word for honor means \"to prize and value.\" Jesus modeled what it means to prize and value parents. When Jesus was twelve years old, He honored His parents, Joseph and Mary, when they found Him in the Temple. \"Then he returned to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. And his mother stored all these things in her heart.\" (Luke 2:51). Jesus rebuked the religious leaders for their disregard of God's commandment to honor parents. They taught it was more important to follow church traditions than to show honor to their parents! (Matthew 15:3-6). Solomon wrote in the book of Proverbs about honoring your parents. \"My child, listen when your father corrects you. Don't neglect your mother's instruction. What you learn from them will crown you with grace and be a chain of honor around your neck.\" (Proverbs 3:8-9). When we honor our parents, listening and obeying what they say, we will receive wisdom, grace, and honor!"}]}

When we are young, it may seem like this world will last forever. As we grow older, we begin to realize that time is very short compared to eternity. Our thoughts and plans should stretch beyond this earth! Hebrews 13:14 says, \"For this world is not our permanent home; we are looking forward to a home yet to come.\" It is so easy to focus on our needs and wants each day rather than God's will for our lives now and beyond. 1 John 2:17 says, \"And this world is fading away, along with everything that people crave. But anyone who does what pleases God will live forever.\" Doesn't it make sense to focus on what will last forever? The earth is not our permanent home; this life will not last. The things of God are forever while the things of this earth are temporary. James 4:14 reminds us of this reality. \"How do you know what your life will be like tomorrow? Your life is like the morning fog--it's here a little while, then it's gone.\" Time is short and we must make the most of it. There is nothing wrong with pursuing success and possessions on this earth. But, it cannot be our primary focus. Seek God for His purpose for your life and pursue it with all you've got - today! Jesus said: \"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\" (Matthew 6:19-21).

For who by himself is able to govern this great people of yours?\" (1 Kings 3:9). Solomon's prayer was to receive God's help to rule God's people. He wanted to make good decisions and judge according to God's Word and will. Solomon loved and cared for God's people. He cared enough to make this request above anything else he could have asked for! To truly love God, we must also love His people. There are no exceptions! 1 John 4:7-8 says, \"Dear friends, let us continue to love one another, for love comes from God. Anyone who loves is a child of God and knows God. But anyone who does not love does not know God, for God is love.\" God is not just filled with love; He IS love; the source of love! Think of what these verses say - If we don't love one another, we do not know God! This Passage makes it clear that loving God and others go hand and hand. Jesus replied, \"'you must love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your mind.' This is the first and greatest commandment. A second is equally important: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'\" (Matthew 22:37-39). How important is it to love God and others? Jesus said it was the second most important commandment and just as important as the first commandment! God is love; so since we are made in His image, we were created to love too!

But, what is the most effective way to pray? Once Jesus was in a certain place praying. As he finished, one of his disciples asked Him to teach them how to pray. Jesus gave His disciples a prayer model to use called \"The Lord's Prayer\". Jesus said, \"Pray like this: Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy. May your Kingdom come soon. May your will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us today the food we need, and forgive us our sins, as we have forgiven those who sin against us. And don't let us yield to temptation, but rescue us from the evil one.\" (Matthew 6:9-13; Luke 11:2-4). Jesus example shows us that prayer is far more than just telling God what we want and need. Prayer begins with worship; acknowledging who He is \" a holy God above heaven and earth. In doing this we build our faith understanding that He has power over everything and everyone; nothing is impossible for Him! We are to pray for God's will; that His purpose and plan are accomplished on this earth. Notice how the beginning of prayer is focused on God- not us! Then we are to pray for what we need, including forgiveness as we forgive others! We also are to ask God's help and protection from temptation and the evil one- Satan. This is how Jesus teaches us to pray! In Matthew 6:5-6, Jesus also warns us to not make a show of our prayers. This is a humble, intimately private time between God and us. Jesus also instructs us to be persistent in our prayers and to never give up. (Luke 11:9-10; Luke 18:1-14). Jesus tells us to pray according to His will and we will have whatever we ask! (1 John 5:14). When we pray in Jesus' name and according to His will, Jesus will answer our prayer and bring glory to God! (John 14:13). Jesus sent the Holy Spirit to be our helper, guide, and teacher. The Holy Spirit will help us to pray effectively and according to God's will. \"And the Holy Spirit helps us in our weakness. For example, we don't know what God wants us to pray for. But the Holy Spirit prays for us with groanings that cannot be expressed in words. And the Father who knows all hearts knows what the Spirit is saying, for the Spirit pleads for us believers in harmony with God's own will. (Romans 8:26-27).

(1 Timothy 2:4; 2 Peter 3:9). To accomplish this end, Jesus issued The Great Commission to His disciples, including us! \"Therefore, go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Teach these new disciples to obey all the commands I have given you. And be sure of this: I am with you always, even to the end of the age.\" (Matthew 28:19-20). The problem is that not all people are willing to go! This was an issue in Jesus' day and is still the case today. Jesus told His disciples to pray for more workers who were willing to work in God's harvest. Luke 10:1-2 says, \"The Lord now chose seventy-two other disciples and sent them ahead in pairs to all the towns and places he planned to visit. These were his instructions to them: \"The harvest is great, but the workers are few. So pray to the Lord who is in charge of the harvest; ask him to send more workers into his fields.\" As believers, it is of utmost importance to pray for workers to spread the Gospel and to make disciples. In John 4:35-38, Jesus tells His disciples exactly what God's harvest is. \"You know the saying, 'Four months between planting and harvest.' But I say, wake up and look around. The fields are already ripe for harvest. The harvesters are paid good wages, and the fruit they harvest is people brought to eternal life. What joy awaits both the planter and the harvester alike! You know the saying, 'One plants and another harvests.' And it's true. I sent you to harvest where you didn't plant; others had already done the work, and now you will get to gather the harvest.\" God's harvest is people! He asks us to participate in His harvest by sharing the Gospel and praying for others to do His work too! All God needs are workers! Romans 10:13-15 says: For \"Everyone who calls on the name of the LORD will be saved.\" But how can they call on him to save them unless they believe in him? And how can they believe in him if they have never heard about him? And how can they hear about him unless someone tells them? And how will anyone go and tell them without being sent? That is why the Scriptures say, \"How beautiful are the feet of messengers who bring good news!\" What a privilege we have to participate in God's harvest! No matter what part we play; God's joy and blessings awaits us for participating!"}]}

His authority never ends and is not limited. \"Jesus came and told his disciples, \"I have been given all authority in heaven and on earth. Therefore, go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Teach these new disciples to obey all the commands I have given you. And be sure of this: I am with you always, even to the end of the age.\" (Matthew 28:18-20) The disciples were sent out by Jesus and given His authority to share the Gospel, baptize and make disciples of new believers. Jesus promised to always be with them until the end of the earth. Matthew 10:1 says, \"Jesus called His twelve disciples together and gave them authority to cast out evil spirits and to heal every kind of disease and illness.\" The question is, does this apply to us today or what is just for believers in Jesus' day? Hebrews 13:8 says: \"Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.\" If Jesus gave authority to believers then, He still gives authority to us now! In John 14:12-14 Jesus says, \"I tell you the truth, anyone who believes in me will do the same works I have done, and even greater works, because I am going to be with the Father. You can ask for anything in my name, and I will do it, so that the Son can bring glory to the Father. Yes, ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it! As believers in Him, we will do even greater, in other words, more works, because He is in heaven to help us. Jesus' work on earth was limited when He was a man to where He was present. More work was accomplished by His authority as His disciples were sent out. Imagine now, with Jesus in Heaven, how much greater the scope of His works can be. When we ask in His name, or by the authority of His name, according to His will, He will grant our request! How powerful is our authority in Christ? Luke 10:19 says, \"Look, I have given you authority over all the power of the enemy, and you can walk among snakes and scorpions and crush them. Nothing will injure you.\" Believers need to understand and operate under Jesus' authority. When we do, the enemy cannot stand against us and God's will can be accomplished!"}]}

Exodus 20:16 says, \"You must not testify falsely against your neighbors.\" Words are powerful; they can wound and damage reputations. This is what the people wanted to do to Jeremiah. If they could damage his reputation, no one would trust him and follow his instructions. The Bible warns us to stay away from those who spread rumors or gossip. \"A gossip goes around telling secrets, so don't hang around with chatterers.\" (Proverbs 20:19). Instead, the Bible tells us to look for ways to achieve peace and to maintain it. God's word even connects a long and prosperous life with the words we speak! \"(12) Does anyone want to live a life that is long and prosperous? (13) Then keep your tongue from speaking evil and your lips from telling lies! (14) Turn away from evil and do good. Search for peace, and work to maintain it. Then keep your tongue from speaking evil and your lips from telling lies!\" (Psalm 34: 12-14). Yes, it is harmful to spread lies and unkind things about others. God is not pleased with this kind of behavior. What comes from our mouths is important to God and so it must be important to us. Our words actually represent the condition of our heart!. \"A good person produces good things from the treasury of a good heart, and an evil person produces evil things from the treasury of an evil heart. What you say flows from what is in your heart.\"(Luke 6:45)."}]}

Jeremiah 19:15 says, \"This is what the Lord of Heaven's Armies, the God of Israel, says: 'I will bring disaster upon this city and its surrounding towns as I promised, because you have stubbornly refused to listen to me.'\" Most of us have chosen to be stubborn at some time in our lives; refusing to do something or to stop something we are doing! This is not pleasing to God. Stubbornness is actually resisting the Holy Spirit's correction and direction (Acts 7:51). It causes us to do our will instead of God's will. How dangerous is stubbornness? The Bible considers stubbornness the same as worshiping idols! (1 Samuel 15:23). Stubbornness is rooted in pride; believing that we know what is best. If we instead choose to humble ourselves before God, He will bless our lives. We can avoid what is harmful to us and what hinders us from growing closer to Him.

What can mere people do to me?\" (Hebrews 13:6). We cannot stand on our own power and in our own strength. We need the strength of God's Spirit inside us to overcome the pressures, the temptations, and the evil of this world. Paul prayed for the Ephesian people to have this kind of strength. \"I pray that from his glorious, unlimited resources he will empower you with inner strength through his Spirit.\" (Ephesians 3:16).

God said \"But my people would not listen to me. They kept doing whatever they wanted, following the stubborn desires of their evil hearts. They went backward instead of forward.\" (Jeremiah 7:24). We don't want to go backwards! We want to go forward with God and to grow more like Christ! In the days of Jeremiah, God did not want to punish His people. He desired that they confess their sins and turn to Him, so they might receive His mercy and forgiveness. It is the same for us today. God wants us to be honest with Him, admit our sins, and turn away from evil so we might receive His forgiveness and mercy! \"People who conceal their sins will not prosper, but if they confess and turn from them, they will receive mercy.\" (Proverbs 28:13).

And don't be afraid of the people, for I will be with you and will protect you. I, the Lord, have spoken!\" (Jeremiah 1:1-8). Have you ever thought you were too young to do something for God? No one is ever too young or too old to do God's work. You see, it isn't about us \" it's all about God! God created and breathed life into us. He gives us all of our ability. We are just empty vessels ready for His use! (2 Timothy 2:21). Mary was a young girl when Gabriel brought the news that she would give birth to Jesus. Samuel, was only a boy, when he faithfully served the Lord in the Temple (1 Samuel 2:18). Josiah was eight years old when he became king of Judah and ruled for thirty-one years (2 Kings 22:1). There are many examples of young girls and boys who were chosen by God to do amazing things for Him. Paul wrote a letter to encourage Timothy, his young friend and faithful helper, to be strong and lead others by example. \"Teach these things and insist that everyone learn them. Don't let anyone think less of you because you are young. Be an example to all believers in what you say, in the way you live, in your love, your faith, and your purity.\" (1 Timothy 4:11-12).

The governor of Cypress was saved when he believed the Word of the Lord shared by Paul and Barnabas (Acts:13:12) In Acts 13:47, Paul and Barnabas said, \"For the Lord gave us this command when He said; 'I have made you a light to the Gentiles, to bring salvation to the farthest corners of the earth.\" The light they brought is the Gospel which holds the power of salvation!

They will never be condemned for their sins, but they have already passed from death into life.\" The Gospel contains the power to instantly move a believer from death to life!

(Acts 11:24) After Saul encountered Jesus on the road to Damascus and became a believer, he desired to meet with the believers in Jerusalem. Unfortunately, they were not anxious to meet him. They were afraid of Saul and didn't believe he was really a changed man! Barnabas to the rescue! He gave Saul a second chance and believed he was a changed man. Barnabas then brought him to the apostles and put in a good word for him. The apostles accepted Saul and he began to boldly preach around Jerusalem. (Acts 9:26-28). Barnabas was a peacemaker and seemed to look for the best in people. After John Mark had deserted Paul and Barnabas on their first journey, it was Barnabas who wanted to give John Mark a second chance. Paul was unwilling to do this and this caused a split in their relationship. Barnabas traveled with John Mark and Paul chose to continue his journey with Silas. Yes, Barnabas had gone to bat for Saul (Paul), and he was now willing to do the same for John Mark! Barnabas did not look down on John Mark or condemn him for his previous decision to leave them. (Acts 15:36-41). Ephesians 4:2-3 says, \"Always be humble and gentle. Be patient with each other, making allowance for each other's faults because of your love. Make every effort to keep yourselves united in the Spirit, binding yourselves together with peace.\" Barnabas did not give up on John Mark, and his efforts to keep the peace and unity between Paul and John Mark were rewarded some time later. Paul later called John Mark a co-worker and helper in his ministry. He requested that John Mark come see him in the later years of Paul's life. (Philemon 1:24; 2 Timothy 4:9-11). Romans 12:10 tells us to love each other with genuine affection, and take delight in honoring each other. Barnabas delighted in honoring others and what God was doing in them.

Barnabas was this type of person. He always seemed to come alongside others who needed help. He was an encourager; so much so that the meaning of the nickname the other apostles gave him was \"Son of Encouragement\" (Acts 4:36). He had a desire to help others grow in the Lord and to function in the gift and calling God had for them. He was willing to support others when it seemed no one else would. We see that with Saul (Paul), John Mark, and the churches that Paul and he ministered to. (Acts 9:26-28; Acts 11:22-23; Acts 14:21-25; Acts15:36-39). Have you ever been around someone that seems to delight in kicking others when they are down? They choose to tear down or condemn others when they make a mistake or fall into sin instead of building up and helping them to overcome. As followers of Christ, we have a responsibility and a calling to be like Barnabas; to build up instead of tear down. The Bible calls us to be encouragers. \"Brothers and sisters, we urge you to warn those who are lazy. Encourage those who are timid. Take tender care of those who are weak. Be patient with everyone.\" (1 Thessalonians 5:14). The world might cast aside the lazy, weak, or timid; yet, this passage tells us we are to be different. Yes, we are called to help others succeed; it is our responsibility! Ecclesiastes 4:9-10 says, \"Two people are better off than one, for they can help each other succeed. If one person falls, the other can reach out and help. But someone who falls alone is in real trouble.\" Rather than kick others when they are down, we are called to reach out and help them up. This is what Barnabas did and this is what Jesus did while He was on the earth. He reached out and touched those who others had written off and cast aside.

In a very angry and stressful situation, he was one voice against many. Because of His advice, the apostle's very lives were saved. (Acts 5:33-40). Barnabas was the only one willing to stand up for Saul (Paul) when he became a believer in Jesus. The believers and leaders in Jerusalem were afraid of Paul. They didn't think his conversion was genuine. Barnabas brought him to the apostles and testified on his behalf. (Acts 9:26-28). In the Old Testament, Joshua was willing to make a stand for God and challenged God's people to do the same. (Joshua 24:15). He didn't wait to see what the majority would do before he chose a side. No, Joshua made his stand first! When we know something is right, we must do it! James 4:17 says, \"Remember, it is sin to know what you ought to do and then not do it.\" Paul and Barnabas met opposition in different cities that they traveled to. However, they continued to boldly stand for the truth of God's Word. \"The same thing happened in Iconium. Paul and Barnabas went to the Jewish synagogue and preached with such power that a great number of both Jews and Greeks became believers. Some of the Jews, however, spurned God's message and poisoned the minds of the Gentiles against Paul and Barnabas. But the apostles stayed there a long time, preaching boldly about the grace of the Lord. And the Lord proved their message was true by giving them power to do miraculous signs and wonders. But the people of the town were divided in their opinion about them. Some sided with the Jews, and some with the apostles.\" (Acts 14:1-4). Even with signs and wonders confirming their words, some still didn't believe. This did not stop the apostles; they continued to stand up for what was right! It is rarely easy to make a stand for what is right. There will often be strong opposition to God's Word.

Acts 4:37 says, \"He sold a field he owned and brought the money to the apostles.\" Barnabas wanted to support the early church and provide for the needs of other believers. There was not a requirement to give the entire amount, yet he chose to. Being generous does not always mean giving large sums of money. Have you heard the phrase, quality is more important than quantity? This certainly applies to giving in God's kingdom. Jesus observed people giving an offering in the Jerusalem Temple. Many rich people gave large sums of money. These givers were not the ones who Jesus took notice of. It was a poor widow that dropped in two small coins that Jesus brought to the disciples' attention. Jesus called his disciples to him and said, \"I tell you the truth, this poor widow has given more than all the others who are making contributions. For they gave a tiny part of their surplus, but she, poor as she is, has given everything she had to live on.\" (Mark 12:41-44). God looks at the motive of our hearts when we give. He knows if we give it grudgingly or cheerfully. 2 Corinthians 9:7 says, \" You must each decide in your heart how much to give. And don't give reluctantly or in response to pressure. \"For God loves a person who gives cheerfully.\" Being generous is not just limited to giving our money to God's work and to others. Barnabas and Paul were also generous with their time. \"Then Barnabas went on to Tarsus to look for Saul. When he found him, he brought him back to Antioch. Both of them stayed there with the church for a full year, teaching large crowds of people.\" (Acts 11:25-26). These men generously chose to go back to places they had already been to follow up with the believers to encourage and strengthen them in their faith. (Acts 15:36; Acts 14:21-28). God wants us to be generous because He is generous with us! 2 Cor. 9:10-11 says, \"For God is the one who provides seed for the farmer and then bread to eat. In the same way, he will provide and increase your resources and then produce a great harvest of generosity in you. Yes, you will be enriched in every way so that you can always be generous. And when we take your gifts to those who need them, they will thank God.\" Yes, God blesses us to bless others! 1 Timothy 6:17-19 says, \"Teach those who are rich in this world not to be proud and not to trust in their money, which is so unreliable. Their trust should be in God, who richly gives us all we need for our enjoyment. Tell them to use their money to do good.

For many years he claimed to be great and soaked up the praise of the people. Acts:8:10 says, \" Everyone, from the least to the greatest, often spoke of him as \"the Great One the Power of God.\" However, things changed when Philip came to Samaria. The people believed God's Word and were amazed at the signs and miracles that accompanied Philip. In fact, his ministry was so powerful that even Simon believed and was baptized! Simon then followed Philip everywhere he went. He was attracted and amazed by the miracles that Philip performed by God's power. (Acts:8:5-7, Acts:8:12-13) When Peter and John came to Samaria, they laid hands on people to receive the Holy Spirit. Simon wanted this power so much that he offered money to buy it from Peter! Peter rebuked him and revealed that Simon's heart was not right with God. It was full of jealousy, wickedness, and sin. Simon was probably sincere when he first believed and was baptized. Yet, instead of seeking God and a closer relationship with Him, Simon sought God's power first. It seems he wanted to attract large crowds again and amaze those who followed him, just like Philip. Simon was all about earthly power and fame. (Acts:8:14-23). As followers of Christ, we are to seek God above all else. Colossians:3:1-2 says, \"Since you have been raised to new life with Christ, set your sights on the realities of heaven, where Christ sits in the place of honor at God's right hand. Think about the things of heaven, not the things of earth.\" Simon set his sights on the things of the world and thought about what he could do with God's power for his own benefit. Matthew:6:33 says, \"Seek the Kingdom of God above all else, and live righteously, and he will give you everything you need.\" God never tells us to seek power on this earth. He tells us to seek His face and live for Him. He promises then to give us all we need. Jesus, when He came to earth, refused to set up an earthly kingdom even when His followers tried to make Him king. Jesus instead came to seek God, to do His will on the earth, and to prepare us to live with Him in God's spiritual kingdom. (John:6:15, John:18:36) Instead of seeking earthly power, we are to live to serve God and humble ourselves before Him. When we do that, He will exalt and lift us up at the right time. 1 Peter:5:6 says, \"So humble yourselves under the mighty power of God, and at the right time he will lift you up in honor.\""}]}

Perhaps that doesn't sound very important or exciting. But, listen to what happened when he and the other deacons did their jobs. \"These seven were presented to the apostles, who prayed for them as they laid their hands on them. So God's message continued to spread. The number of believers greatly increased in Jerusalem, and many of the Jewish priests were converted, too.\" (Acts:8:6-7) We see that the deacon's role was important because it freed up the apostles to pray, study, and preach God's Word instead of doing tasks like feeding the widows in the church. The church continued to grow and even some Jewish priests became believers; that's powerful! When Philip was sharing the Gospel in Samaria, he also baptized the new believers in water. Peter and John came to Samaria and then baptized these believers in the Spirit. Philip, Peter and John had different roles and all worked together to accomplish God's work. (Acts:8:4-17). Every job, no matter how big or small it may appear, is important in God's Kingdom. The apostle Paul talked about this topic in 1 Corinthians:5:9: \"After all, who is Apollos? Who is Paul? We are only God's servants through whom you believed the Good News. Each of us did the work the Lord gave us. I planted the seed in your hearts, and Apollos watered it, but it was God who made it grow. It's not important who does the planting, or who does the watering. What's important is that God makes the seed grow. The one who plants and the one who waters work together with the same purpose. And both will be rewarded for their own hard work. For we are both God's workers. And you are God's field. You are God's building.\" In God's kingdom we work hand in hand with each other and God! The Holy Spirit orchestrates and anoints God's followers to work in harmony with each other to do God's will. \"There are different kinds of spiritual gifts, but the same Spirit is the source of them all. There are different kinds of service, but we serve the same Lord. God works in different ways, but it is the same God who does the work in all of us. It is the one and only Spirit who distributes all these gifts. He alone decides which gift each person should have.\" (1 Corinthians:12:4-6,11)"}]}

Everyone who believes has eternal life; that's it period! Philip preached the Good News and performed miracles to confirm that Word. Many believed and were baptized. Philip did not preach a complicated message. He did not require that they sign a paper and promise to keep all of the Jewish laws and customs of that day. He simply preached the Good News. Those who believed were saved and baptized in water. Peter and John came later to baptize these believers in the Spirit. By God pouring out His Spirit on these non-Jews, or Gentiles, He removed any doubt of their salvation and acceptance by Him! (Acts:8:4-8, Acts:12-17) The fact is that God wants us all to be saved; He on purpose made it a simple process. (2 Peter:3:9). Romans:10:13 makes it very clear: \"For everyone who calls on the name of the LORD will be saved.\" The key word in the verse is \"everyone\". Man creates rules and religion to make it seem difficult, but this is not God's way. Jesus rebuked the Pharisees and religious leaders for adding conditions and rules to for the people to follow that even they could not keep. (Luke:11:37-52) In Acts:16:29-32, the jailer fell down before Paul and Silas and asked what he must do to be saved. \"The jailer called for lights and ran to the dungeon and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas. Then he brought them out and asked, \"Sirs, what must I do to be saved?\" They replied, \"Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved, along with everyone in your household.\" What exciting news the jailer learned; not only he, but his whole family simply needed to believe in Jesus to be saved! The Ethiopian Eunuch was reading Scripture from the book of Isaiah. Philip, led by the Holy Spirit, came alongside his carriage as he read. \"The eunuch asked Philip, \"Tell me, was the prophet talking about himself or someone else?\" So beginning with this same Scripture, Philip told him the Good News about Jesus.\" Philip simply shared the Good News and the man received Jesus! A short time later, the eunuch saw some water in the desert and asked Philip to baptize him. After he was baptized, the eunuch went on his way rejoicing! God's plan of salvation is not burdensome or hard; it is easy and brings us freedom and joy! Romans:10:9 says, \"If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.\""}]}

(Acts:8:8) When the Ethiopian Eunuch received the Good news and was baptized, he went on his way rejoicing! (Acts:8:39) Our salvation is not based on feelings; it is based on believing or by faith in Jesus. However, we can't help but be filled with the joy of the Lord! This is exactly what Jesus wants to give us! In John:17:13, Jesus said: \"Now I am coming to you. I told them many things while I was with them in this world so they would be filled with my joy.\" The new church in Jerusalem was filled with excitement and joy. Acts:2:43-47 says, \"A deep sense of awe came over them all, and the apostles performed many miraculous signs and wonders. And all the believers met together in one place and shared everything they had. They sold their property and possessions and shared the money with those in need. They worshiped together at the Temple each day, met in homes for the Lord's Supper, and shared their meals with great joy and generosity all the while praising God and enjoying the goodwill of all the people. And each day the Lord added to their fellowship those who were being saved.\" Yes, joy comes as a direct result of our salvation and relationship with God and other believers. Paul and Barnabas brought the Gospel to the Gentiles and they thanked the Lord for His message. The Good News Spread and many became believers. The Jewish religious leaders eventually ran Paul and Barnabas out of town but the joy of the Lord from receiving the Good News could not be stopped! \"And the believers were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.\" (Acts:13:48-52). As believers in Christ, our lives should be filled with joy as we live for Jesus! 1 Peter:1:8 says, \"You love him even though you have never seen him.

He couldn't have imagined what Jesus was about to tell him. Here he was, a respected teacher and Pharisee leader at an old age. Surely this would mean something as far as entering God's kingdom. Jesus wasted no time in telling him what was required; simply, he must be born again. All of Nicodemus' education, teaching, knowledge of the Law, good deeds, and giving did not give him entrance into the Kingdom to secure him a place in heaven for eternity. Only a new birth by God's Word and Spirit could do that. (John:3:5-7). What a humbling and confusing moment this must have been for Nicodemus. (John:3:1-16. Ephesians:2:8-9 is clear that nothing we do by our flesh, in other words, by our own effort or power, can obtain salvation for us. It is only accomplished by God's Spirit. What does it mean to be born again? It is a spiritual rebirth, starting a brand-new life in the Spirit. All we need to do is believe and trust in Jesus and the work He did on the cross. When we confess Him as our Lord and Savior, the Bible says that we become a new person in Christ. The old life is gone; a new life has begun! (2 Corinthians:5:17) Titus 3:5 says it so well; \"He saved us, not because of the righteous things we had done, but because of His mercy. He washed away our sins, giving us a new birth and new life through the Holy Spirit.\" Isn't that fantastic? Jesus' instructions were not just for Nicodemus; everyone must be reborn by God's Spirit; there are no other options that God gave us to enter His spiritual kingdom. Jesus explained to Nicodemus, it isn't about a natural birth, it is about a supernatural birth by God's Spirit. Though no one can fully understand how it happens, we believe by faith what the Holy Spirit does inside us as we trust in Jesus as our Lord and Savior. (Romans:10:9)."}]}

Very simply, Jesus came in obedience to God's plan to rescue us and set us free from sin and bondage, so we might serve Him on this earth and live with Him in heaven for all of eternity! That's a mouthful isn't it? John 3:16-19 says this about God's plan and Jesus' purpose: \"For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him. Whoever believes in Him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God's one and only Son. This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil.\" God has one way to escape His judgment and punishment for sin; through belief in Jesus, His only Son. This was Jesus' purpose and mission that He perfectly fulfilled. Jesus came to save us not to condemn and punish us. Mankind is hopelessly lost and trapped in sin; God gives us a choice to remain in darkness or come to the light of Jesus and be free! Jesus' purpose Is revealed in one verse: Luke 19:10 says, \"The Son of Man came to seek and save those who are lost.\" While on the earth, Jesus forgave sins and set people free from all kinds of bondage and disease. Jesus caused an uproar with the Pharisees when He healed a woman on the Sabbath day who had been in bondage for eighteen years. He even chose to do this in the Synagogue! Jesus incensed the religious leaders again when He healed a man who had a disease that caused his arms and legs to swell \" this time, at a Pharisee's home! (Luke:13:10-16, Luke:14:1-6). Nicodemus took note of these miracles and knew deep in his heart that God had sent Jesus and was working through Him. Jesus stated what He was all about in Luke 4:18. \"The Spirit of the LORD is upon Me, for He has anointed Me to bring Good News to the poor. He has sent Me to proclaim that captives will be released, that the blind will see, that the oppressed will be set free.\" Jesus knew what He came to Earth to do. His mission is to set people free in this world and for all of eternity."}]}

Genesis 2:1-3 says, \"So the creation of the heavens and the earth and everything in them was completed. On the seventh day God had finished His work of creation, so He rested from all His work. And God blessed the seventh day and declared it holy, because it was the day when He rested from all His work of creation.\" God does not require rest or grow weary, yet, He chose to take the time to step back and admire His fabulous creation over the past six days. God knows that we, as frail humans, need a time to step back from all of our work and responsibilities to rest. In this time, we can admire God and His creation, and recharge and strengthen ourselves. In the Bible, we read many times where Jesus modeled this to His disciples and to us. He purposefully withdrew from the crowds and His disciples to spend time and relax with God. In this time, He received instructions and strength for the day's journey. (Luke:5:16, Mark:1:35, Luke:9:28, Mark:6:30-32) We, too, should do as Jesus did each day. However, God also requires us to take one special day each week to honor Him and to pause from our many activities and responsibilities. In this time, we can renew ourselves physically, spiritually, and emotionally. This is God's directive not to burden us, but to bless and benefit us. Jesus infuriated the religious leaders, particularly the Pharisees by healing people on the Sabbath. They were not excited to see people who had been sick and bound for many years, be set free! No, Jesus, in their minds, broke the rules! But, Jesus had come to set people free; no matter what day it was; this was His mission! He often rebuked the Pharisees for their criticism, self-righteousness, and hypocrisy. (Matthew:23:1-36) In Luke 13: 10-17. Jesus silenced the Pharisees when they became angry that He healed a woman on the Sabbath day in the Synagogue! \"But the Lord replied, \"You hypocrites! Each of you works on the Sabbath day! Don't you untie your ox or your donkey from its stall on the Sabbath and lead it out for water? This dear woman, a daughter of Abraham, has been held in bondage by Satan for eighteen years. Isn't it right that she be released, even on the Sabbath?\" (Luke:13: 15-17) Jesus was saying that there was actually no better day than the Lord's day to set someone free from bondage! The same applies for today! Verse 17 says, \"This shamed His enemies, but all the people rejoiced at the wonderful things He did.\" Soon after, Jesus was at it again, much to the displeasure of the Pharisees. He healed a man on the Sabbath day, and this time in a Pharisee's home! Jesus asked the Pharisees if they believed it was legal to heal on the Sabbath? They remained silent. Jesus promptly took hold of the man, healed him and sent him on his way! (Luke:14:1-4) \"Then he asked them, \"If one of you has a child or an ox that falls into a well on the Sabbath day, will you not immediately pull it out?\" And they had nothing to say.\" (Luke:14:5-6) In Matthew 12: 1-14, Jesus once again encountered the wrath and hypocrisy of the Pharisees. They took issue when Jesus and His disciples walked through a grain field and his disciples picked wheat to eat when they were hungry. How dare they strengthen and nourish themselves on the Sabbath! Jesus silenced them by reminding them of the Scripture when King David ate the bread on the Sabbath in the Temple. \"I tell you, there is one here who is even greater than the Temple! But you would not have condemned My innocent disciples if you knew the meaning of this Scripture: 'I want you to show mercy, not offer sacrifices.' For the Son of Man is Lord, even over the Sabbath!\" (Matthew:12:6-8) In this same account in the book of Mark, Jesus tells us the purpose of the Sabbath. Then Jesus said to them, \"The Sabbath was made to meet the needs of people, and not people to meet the requirements of the Sabbath. So, the Son of Man is Lord, even over the Sabbath!\" (Mark:2:27-28) Yes, Jesus declared Himself Lord of the Sabbath He, not them, would determine how to observe God's Holy day made for man! His desire was for them to show mercy to others and help them instead of performing their ritualistic and self-righteous acts of worship. Soon afterward, on the Sabbath, the Pharisees tried to trap Him. Jesus was unmoved and healed a man's lame hand in the Synagogue. He told them it was lawful to do good on the Sabbath. At this point, the Pharisees had seen enough, and they plotted to kill Him! (Matthew:12:9-14) There is much discussion and disagreement even today on how the Sabbath day is to be observed. What we do know is that it is a holy day unto God, to honor and worship Him, and to do good to others. It is also a day created specifically for us, not to weigh us down with rules, but to give us a day each week to rest and gain strength. God intended this day to be a blessing and not a burden to His children!"}]}

He had questions and concerns about Jesus and His ministry that conflicted with the Jewish traditions and Law he had studied, taught, lived, and led others to follow. Nicodemus' fellow Pharisees were highly offended by Jesus and plotted to stop His ministry; what was the truth he must know! Did Jesus turn Nicodemus' away because he was a Pharisee also? Absolutely not; Jesus made Himself accessible and engaged in conversation with him. Without a doubt, Jesus' words were not what he expected; but never the less, Jesus talked with him. Jesus will always tell us what we need to hear not necessarily what we want to hear! (John:3:1-16) In Revelation 3:20, we see how Jesus longs and waits to spend time with us. He never will \"break the door to our heart down\", or force us to spend time with Him, but he knocks and patiently waits for us to willingly open the door to welcome Him. \"Look! I stand at the door and knock. If you hear my voice and open the door, I will come in, and we will share a meal together as friends.\" What a wonderful thing to know that Jesus comes to us! In Matthew 11:28-30, Jesus welcomes us to come to give us rest and strength. \"Then Jesus said, \"Come to Me, all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you. Let Me teach you, because I am humble and gentle at heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy to bear, and the burden I give you is light.\" Jesus was truly on a mission for God; His time was limited, but He made time for even the children! Luke 18:15-16 says: \"One day some parents brought their little children to Jesus so He could touch and bless them. But when the disciples saw this, they scolded the parents for bothering Him. Then Jesus called for the children and said to the disciples, \"Let the children come to Me. Don't stop them! For the Kingdom of God belongs to those who are like these children.\" There are countless examples recorded in the Bible of Jesus spending time with people that others had no time for. Zacchaeus, blind Bartimaeus, and the woman with the issue of blood; to name just a few. (Luke:19:1-10, Mark:10:47-52, Luke:8:43-48) And, if all of this isn't exciting enough, we can be confident knowing that our relationship with Him will ever change or come to an end. Jesus will never move away from us. He is with us now and is preparing for us to live with Him forever! \"Don't let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God, and trust also in me. There is more than enough room in my Father's home. If this were not so, would I have told you that I am going to prepare a place for you? When everything is ready, I will come and get you, so that you will always be with Me where I am. And you know the way to where I am going.\" (John:14:1-4) How much of an impact did Jesus' spending time with Nicodemus have? Nicodemus, along with another Pharisee, named Joseph of Arimathea, publicly took Jesus body from the cross after He died. Nicodemus brought expensive spices and ointments to prepare Jesus' body for burial and they laid Him in the tomb. (John:19: 39-40)"}]}

Remember that when Jesus was here on earth, He wasn't in what we call his \"glorified state.\" The Bible tells us that Jesus left His \"glory\" in heaven so that he could come to Earth to be like us, to be a human being. But when we see Jesus in heaven, He will be \"full of glory.\" We can't know exactly what Jesus will look like in heaven, but we can get a pretty good idea from two passages in the New Testament. The first is when He is with Peter, James, and John on the Mount of Transfiguration. It says that His face \"shone like the sun\" or, put another way, that \"sunlight poured from his face.\" It says that His clothes were so bright and white that Peter, James, and John couldn't look at him. The second passage is in the book of Revelation, and it describes Jesus in a similar way. It says that He was dressed in a long robe with a gold sash wrapped around His chest. And it says that His hair was white as snow, and His eyes were like a fiery flame. And His voice sounded like rushing waters. John was so overwhelmed that John fell on his face. It was just too much to be in Jesus' presence. But Jesus said to him, \"Don't be afraid\" (Revelation 1:17). But we can understand why John was afraid. Actually seeing God is no small thing to imagine!"}]}

There are four main things that a child of God needs to do in order to grow spiritually: 1.\tRead the Bible 2.\tPray 3.\tMeet with others Christians (have fellowship) 4.\tTell others about Jesus (witness) It's like a car that needs four pumped up tires to be able to drive well on a road. 1. Read the Bible (in the Old Testament, the Bible is referred to as the Law of the Lord) Psalm 1:2,3 - But they delight in the law of the LORD, meditating on it day and night. They are like trees planted along the riverbank, bearing fruit each season. Their leaves never wither, and they prosper in all they do. a) The Bible helps us to grow as Christians -- just like milk helps a baby to grow. 1 Peter 2:2 - You must crave pure spiritual milk so that you can grow into the fullness of your salvation. Cry out for this nourishment as a baby cries for milk. b) The Bible is like a guidebook on how God wants us to live. Psalm 119:9 - How can a young person stay pure? By obeying your word and following its rules. Psalm 119:11 - I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you. Psalm 119:105 - Your word is a lamp for my feet and a light for my path. c) The Bible is part of the spiritual armor that helps us to fight against the attacks of the devil. Ephesians 6:17 - Take the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God. Matthew 4:10 - \"Get out of here, Satan,\" Jesus told him. \"For the Scriptures say...,\" 2.\tPray Why should I pray? a) Praying is talking to God. When you love someone you want to talk to them. Prayer is a two-way conversation that helps us to grow in our relationship with God. Through prayer, we talk to God and He talks to us. You can talk to God about everything: what's happening in your life, how you feel, what you need. Philippians 4:6 - Don't worry about anything; instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need, and thank him for all he has done. b) Jesus showed us that it was important to pray. Luke 6:12 - One day soon afterward Jesus went up on a mountain to pray, and he prayed to God all night. c) When should I pray? You can pray as often as you can, at any time, about anything and everything. 1 Thessalonians 5:17 - Never stop praying. d)Where should I pray? You can pray to God anywhere. Remember Jonah? He was in the belly of a great fish when he prayed! e) How should I pray? Jesus taught us how to pray when he gave us the Lord's Prayer. The letters of the word ACTS helps us to remember the different aspects of prayer: A - Adoration. Praise God and talk about the wonderful things He has done. C - Confess. Confess your sin to God. Tell Him about the things you have done (and those that you should not have done) as well as the things you haven't done (and should have done). Talk to God about your wrong thoughts and wrong attitudes as well. T - Thanks. Thank God for forgiving you and for all His blessings. S - Supplication. This word means 'to ask'. Ask God for what you, and other people, need. 3.\tFellowship Meet with other Christians regularly - go to church or Sunday school. Perhaps you could join a Bible club, youth group, or go to a Christian camp. Acts 2:42 - They joined with the other believers and devoted themselves to the apostle's teaching and fellowship, sharing in the Lord's Supper and in prayer. Acts 2:44 - And all the believers met together in one place and shared everything they had. 4.\tWitness Tell others about how God loves them so much that he sent Jesus to die so that, if they believe on Him and accept Him as Savior, they can be forgiven and have eternal life. John 3:16 - For God loved the world so much that he gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life. Mark 5:19 - But Jesus said, \"No, go home to your friends, and tell them what wonderful things the Lord has done for you and how merciful he has been.\""}]}

How would he handle the responsibility and the pressure of leading God's people? Who could he go to for trusted help? Solomon did the right thing; with a humble heart he turned to God and asked for wisdom. Solomon described himself as like being a little child who didn't know his way around. He told God that no man could do such an important job alone. He sought the Lord's direction and discernment to know right from wrong. God gave Solomon what he asked for. He made Solomon wiser than anyone on the earth. And, God was so pleased with Solomon's request that God gave him what he didn't ask for; riches and fame! Solomon was also promised a long life if he obeyed God's commands. Solomon used God's wisdom to give judgment for a heartbreaking situation with two mothers and their babies. \"When all Israel heard the king's decision, the people were in awe of the king, for they saw the wisdom God had given him for rendering justice.\" (1 Kings 3:28). Solomon asked for wisdom and God gave it to him and much more. What would you answer if God asked you the same question that He asked Solomon? Proverbs 4:7 says simply, \"Getting wisdom is the wisest thing you can do!\" Wisdom begins and ends with God. God is our endless source of knowledge and understanding for every decision in this life. All we need to do is ask. \"If you need wisdom, ask our generous God, and he will give it to you. He will not rebuke you for asking.\" (James 1:5)."}]}

He made sure that he had reminded his son Solomon to give priority to following God's ways. David knew that if Solomon faithfully followed God, he would enjoy God's blessings in his life no matter where he went or what he did. When we are young, it may seem like this world will last forever. As we grow older, we begin to realize that time is very short compared to eternity. Our thoughts and plans should stretch beyond this earth! Hebrews 13:14 says, \"For this world is not our permanent home; we are looking forward to a home yet to come.\" It is so easy to focus on our needs and wants each day rather than God's will for our lives now and beyond. 1 John 2:17 says, \"And this world is fading away, along with everything that people crave. But anyone who does what pleases God will live forever.\" Doesn't it make sense to focus on what will last forever? The earth is not our permanent home; this life will not last. The things of God are forever while the things of this earth are temporary. James 4:14 reminds us of this reality. \"How do you know what your life will be like tomorrow? Your life is like the morning fog--it's here a little while, then it's gone.\" Time is short and we must make the most of it. There is nothing wrong with pursuing success and possessions on this earth. But, it cannot be our primary focus. Seek God for His purpose for your life and pursue it with all you've got - today! Jesus said: \"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\" (Matthew 6:19-21).

If he did this, Solomon would be successful in all he did. We read that Solomon loved the Lord and followed all the decrees of his father David. (1 Kings 2:1-3). Solomon was successful because of his obedience. He had more wisdom and wealth than any king on earth because of God's blessings upon his life. (1 Kings 3: 12-13). It is important for us to honor our parents; so important that God made it one of the Ten Commandments. Ephesians 6:1-3 says, \"Children, obey your parents because you belong to the Lord, for this is the right thing to do. \"Honor your father and mother.\" This is the first commandment with a promise: If you honor your father and mother, \"things will go well for you, and you will have a long life on the earth.\" As believers in Jesus, we belong to the Lord and must show honor to our parents. How do we do this? To honor someone means not only to obey, but also to show respect with our actions and words. To honor in a way that pleases the Lord, we must not only obey but also do it with a right attitude and heart. That means without grumbling and complaining! The Greek word for honor means \"to prize and value.\" Jesus modeled what it means to prize and value parents. When Jesus was twelve years old, He honored His parents, Joseph and Mary, when they found Him in the Temple. \"Then he returned to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. And his mother stored all these things in her heart.\" (Luke 2:51). Jesus rebuked the religious leaders for their disregard of God's commandment to honor parents. They taught it was more important to follow church traditions than to show honor to their parents! (Matthew 15:3-6). Solomon wrote in the book of Proverbs about honoring your parents. \"My child, listen when your father corrects you. Don't neglect your mother's instruction. What you learn from them will crown you with grace and be a chain of honor around your neck.\" (Proverbs 3:8-9). When we honor our parents, listening and obeying what they say, we will receive wisdom, grace, and honor!"}]}

Solomon did not selfishly ask for riches and fame. Solomon said, \"Give me an understanding heart so that I can govern your people well and know the difference between right and wrong. For who by himself is able to govern this great people of yours?\" (1 Kings 3:9). Solomon's prayer was to receive God's help to rule God's people. He wanted to make good decisions and judge according to God's Word and will. Solomon loved and cared for God's people. He cared enough to make this request above anything else he could have asked for! To truly love God, we must also love His people. There are no exceptions! 1 John 4:7-8 says, \"Dear friends, let us continue to love one another, for love comes from God. Anyone who loves is a child of God and knows God. But anyone who does not love does not know God, for God is love.\" God is not just filled with love; He IS love; the source of love! Think of what these verses say - If we don't love one another, we do not know God! This Passage makes it clear that loving God and others go hand and hand. Jesus replied, \"'you must love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your mind.' This is the first and greatest commandment. A second is equally important: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'\" (Matthew 22:37-39). How important is it to love God and others? Jesus said it was the second most important commandment and just as important as the first commandment! God is love; so since we are made in His image, we were created to love too! (1 John 4:16; Genesis 1:27)."}]}

Any godly parent would be thrilled to hear their child describe them this way. To be honest, true, and faithful is the very definition of integrity. Acts 13:22 says, \"But God removed Saul and replaced him with David, a man about whom God said, 'I have found David son of Jesse, a man after my own heart. He will do everything I want him to do.'\" Was David perfect? No! He committed many sins including adultery and murder. But, David repented before God and pleaded for forgiveness and mercy. Yes, David sinned, but God restored him and blessed his life. It was not the failures that Solomon remembered; it was David's passionate pursuit of God! Here is what God later told Solomon. \"As for you, if you will follow me with integrity and godliness, as David your father did, obeying all my commands, decrees, and regulations, then I will establish the throne of your dynasty over Israel forever.\" (1 Kings 9: 4-5). David had sinned, but God still used him as an example of integrity, godliness, and obedience. So, how can we live a life that is honest, true, and faithful? The answer is, we can't \" on our own! We need help, and God gives us help by from the Holy Spirit who lives in us. God's Spirit leads and guides us in all truth (John 16:13).

The exponential curve, on the other hand, illustrates the enormous potential of compounded growth. The book suggests that together, they can create outstanding results over time. This is pointed out through compounded interest, business growth, and personal development. However, the book warns against the misuse or non-use of resources, as depicted in the parable, that could lead to potential loss or stagnation."}]}

Part of that time is allotted to Chris and Joy in their modern-day setting so kids can learn an important and relevant life lesson. As you can see, we simply do not have enough time to cover every aspect of the biblical stories.

The Bible tells us, In fact, according to the law of Moses, nearly everything was purified with blood. For without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness (Hebrews 9:22 NLT). The animal that was sacrificed had to be without any defect. This points to the sinlessness of Jesus Christ who died for the sins of mankind.

When the king of Nineveh heard what Jonah was saying, he stepped down from his throne and took off his royal robes. He dressed himself in burlap and sat on a heap of ashes.

Additionally, historians have discovered that when Roman soldiers crucified people, they drove the nails through the palms, wrists or forearms. (If Jesus was nailed through His palms, then the soldiers would have also tied His arms to the cross with ropes.) So it is possible that Jesus was nailed through either His palms or wrists.

One of the reasons why the patriarchs lived longer may be that their DNA had fewer imperfections. When God created Adam and Eve, their DNA would have been perfect, but succeeding generations could have experienced increasing amounts of genetic mutations which could have left them more vulnerable to the aging process and disease.

In the case of \"The Prodigal Son,\" we wanted to realistically illustrate the downward turn of events in the Prodigal Son's life as he followed the sinful ways of the world. We also wanted to show the disastrous consequences of his reckless behavior. On the other hand, we were careful to avoid depicting any indecent activity. In addition, when Jesus told the parable of the prodigal son, His listeners would have readily understood the implied elements of the story. However, since today's listeners are living in a very different culture and historical period, they might not perceive some of the story's implications. To overcome this difficulty, we provided a visual depiction of the Prodigal Son's wild living in a distant land (Luke 15:13 NLT). Because children differ in their spiritual development, sensitivity to dramatic depictions, and the type of programming they are accustomed to viewing, we suggest that parents consider which episodes are appropriate for each of their children. For this DVD, we included an important note to parents in red font encouraging them to preview the episode before showing it to their children.
