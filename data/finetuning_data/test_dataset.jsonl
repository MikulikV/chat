When we hear Him, it is important that we obey what He is telling us to do. Your parents and pastor can help you to learn how to confirm God's guidance in your life.

Aren't you glad that God plans ahead? Sin separates you from God, but God has always had a plan for you. From Genesis to Revelation, we read about God's plan of salvation. In the Old Testament, there are many \"pictures,\" references, or stories that point to Jesus. When God spoke to the serpent, He referred to Christ's victory over Satan through Jesus' death on the cross: “And I will put enmity between you and the woman, And between your seed and her Seed; He shall bruise your head, And you shall bruise His heel\" (Genesis 3:15, NKJV).

We all need to learn obedience: to choose to resist temptation and to obey God. Deuteronomy 11:26-28 emphasizes this choice.

Have you ever been afraid and thought you were alone? We all have. What could we see if God opened our spiritual eyes like Elisha's servant? God is always with us and He is for us! Romans 8:31 says, “What shall we say about such wonderful things as these? If God is for us, who can ever be against us?” As a follower of Jesus, you may find yourself pressured to do or say things that are contrary to God's Word. It isn't easy to be outnumbered! With God, we are never alone. Like Elijah and his servant, we outnumber whomever or whatever comes against us. When the soldiers came to arrest Jesus in the garden, Peter drew his sword and cut off a man's ear. Jesus rebuked Peter and said, “Don't you realize that I could ask my Father for thousands of angels to protect us, and he would send them instantly?” (Matthew 26:52-53) Jesus didn't submit to the guards because He was outnumbered or overpowered. He knew God was for Him and His angels were at His command. Jesus chose to give himself up to follow God's plan. Yes, God is for us! “The Lord is for me, so I will have no fear.

When we make the wrong choice we make mistakes. When God created humanity, He made us in His image and likeness with a free will, which means that He created us with the freedom to choose between right and wrong. God wanted a family. He didn't want robots. As a result, we are free to either follow after God's ways, or we can choose to rebel against the truths of Scripture. Adam and Eve were given a choice in the Garden of Eden – and sadly, they chose to disobey God. After the fall, God set in motion a plan to redeem mankind through the loving sacrifice of Jesus – and all we have to do is “choose” to believe in Him and we will be saved. Once we are saved, we have to continually choose to obey God and follow in His ways. However, we are all human and we sometimes make mistakes. The key to abundant life in Jesus is to recognize when we make a mistake, God has given us the free will to make that choice, then to ask God for forgiveness for our sin (1 John 1:9)."}]}

The book of James teaches us, \"Dear brothers and sisters, when troubles come your way, consider it an opportunity for great joy.

All have sinned and come short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23). The wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord (Romans 6:23). But God showed his great love for us by sending Christ to die for us while we were still sinners (Romans 5:8). If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved (Romans 10:9). This SuperTruth is also expressed clearly in the following verses: Colossians 1:20: “And through him God reconciled everything to himself. He made peace with everything in heaven and on earth by means of Christ's blood on the cross.” John 1:12: “But to all who believed him and accepted him, he gave the right to become children of God.”"}]}

He had received encouraging dreams from God and his father loved him very much -- but his life events took a drastic turn. Joseph's jealous brothers tossed him in a pit (Genesis 37:22), sold him into slavery (Genesis 37:27), and then Joseph ended up in prison (Genesis 39:19-20). Throughout these ordeals, Joseph kept his faith in God. By relying on God to help him interpret Pharaoh's dreams, Joseph was given the role of Governor of Egypt. Joseph's life shows us that even when things seem bad, we need to hold fast to God and trust that He will see us through life's challenging situations (2 Thessalonians 3:3)."}]}

It is an encouraging message. John wrote down everything he heard and saw in the Book of Revelation so that Christians would be encouraged, especially in times of persecution.

The Bible tells us that there is great power in our prayers: \"The earnest prayer of a righteous person has great power and produces wonderful results\" (James 5:16). It also says: \"We know that God does not listen to sinners. He listens to the godly person who does his will\" (John 9:31).

We see a clear example of this when the Children of Israel are in the wilderness after God dramatically delivered them from Egypt. Because they complained about their circumstances as they made their way toward the Promised Land, God declared, \"You will all drop dead in this wilderness! Because you complained against me, every one of you who is twenty years old or older and was included in the registration will die\" (Numbers 14:29). The Apostle Paul said, \"Do everything without complaining and arguing\" (Philippians 2:14).

If you find yourself in a situation that seems to be going against the truth of the Bible, first ask the Holy Spirit to give you wisdom.
