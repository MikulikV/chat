But after this happening three times, Eli realized that God was speaking to Samuel. The boy Samuel had to learn how to recognize the voice of God -- but when he did, he became one of the most powerful prophets in the Bible. The good news is that because the Holy Spirit dwells within us, we can also hear God's voice. It takes practice to be able to recognize God's voice from our own thoughts, but eventually, we can know when He is speaking to us. When we hear Him, it is important that we obey what He is telling us to do. Your parents and pastor can help you to learn how to confirm God's guidance in your life. When you learn to hear God, your whole life becomes new -- and it is an exciting adventure with the Holy Spirit!"}]}

Your young men will see visions, and your old men will dream dreams.'\" This is one of the ways that God will speak to us and reveal His will to us. The Bible says in Job 33:14-15, \"For God speaks again and again, though people do not recognize it.

Anything that takes first place in our life is a spiritual idol. Jesus said that the greatest commandment is, \"You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your mind\" (Matthew 22:37). The Ten Commandments teach a similar truth: \"You must not have any other god but me. You must not make for yourself an idol of any kind or an image of anything in the heavens or on the earth or in the sea. You must not bow down to them or worship them, for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God who will not tolerate your affection for any other gods\" (Exodus 20:3-5).

I know what you're thinking: This story ends sad. But the story of Adam and Eve doesn't end here. God's plan for them reveals forgiveness and hope. The Bible teaches that God has a plan (a hope and a future) for all mankind – and that includes YOU, personally. God has a plan for your life, too (Jeremiah 29:11). Aren't you glad that God plans ahead? Sin separates you from God, but God has always had a plan for you. From Genesis to Revelation, we read about God's plan of salvation. In the Old Testament, there are many \"pictures,\" references, or stories that point to Jesus. When God spoke to the serpent, He referred to Christ's victory over Satan through Jesus' death on the cross: “And I will put enmity between you and the woman, And between your seed and her Seed; He shall bruise your head, And you shall bruise His heel\" (Genesis 3:15, NKJV). When God made clothing out of animal skins, it has been said that it points to Jesus, the Lamb of God, who died to save us. Have you thought about Noah's Ark representing salvation through Jesus (Genesis 6, Hebrews 11:7)? Or Jonah being entombed in the great fish for three days before being released (Jonah 1:17, Matthew 12:40)? God's plan for your life involves forgiveness (John 3:16, 1 John 1:9) and gives \"a hope and a future\" (Jeremiah 29:11)."}]}

Adam and Eve chose to obey God until they gave into the temptation of the serpent. God placed Adam and Eve in a beautiful world, gave them clear instructions, and the freedom to follow those rules. When Satan tempted Eve, she could have said \"no.\" Adam and Eve chose to disobey God and to do what they wanted to do instead. We all need to learn obedience: to choose to resist temptation and to obey God. Deuteronomy 11:26-28 emphasizes this choice. The Lord's message is this: “Look, today I am giving you the choice between a blessing and a curse! You will be blessed if you obey the commands of the LORD your God that I am giving you today. But you will be cursed if you reject the commands of the LORD your God and turn away from him and worship gods you have not known before."}]}

God said, “Let there be light” (Genesis 1:3), and, “Let us make...” (Genesis 1:26) – and then it came TRUE. The Bible teaches us that God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit (the Trinity or Triune--that is, three-in-one--God) were present at Creation in the beginning (Genesis 1:1)."}]}

But God spoke to him in a dream and gave him clear instructions to follow. These instructions went against Jewish customs: a \"good\" man like Joseph would not marry a pregnant girl, and he would name his son after himself (like “Joe Junior” – hey, that's kinda catchy).However, the prophecy in Isaiah 7:14 had to be fulfilled: \"All right then, the Lord himself will give you the sign. Look! The virgin will conceive a child! She will give birth to a son and will call him Immanuel.\" Immanuel means \"God with us.\" Joseph did what God told him in his dream, and the world received their Savior in part because of Joseph's obedience to God.

For example, God warns us against worshiping idols (Exodus 20:3-5), gossiping (Proverbs 20:19), using bad language (Ephesians 4:29), and telling lies (Proverbs 6:16-19). He instructs us to love Him wholeheartedly (Matthew 22:37), to be kind and forgiving to others (Ephesians 4:32), and to love our neighbor as ourselves (Matthew 22:38). Following God's instructions will also display our love for Him (John 14:23). Most importantly, God promises to help you follow Him.

God has done so much for us, but sometimes it is hard for someone who does not believe in Him to appreciate and respect that. But God wants us to be a reflection of His love to that person. That is why He wants us to obey His commandments -- especially to \"love your neighbor\" (Matthew 19:19). By obeying God and doing the right thing -- even if sometimes it doesn't seem like the cool thing to do -- you are actually loving your neighbor. They may have never read the Bible or learned what God's plan is for their life. By doing what God says to do, you become like a living page of the Bible for them.

In the same way, let your good deeds shine out for all to see, so that everyone will praise your heavenly Father\" (Matthew 5:15-16). Shine the light that Jesus has placed in you!

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "God spoke to Paul. What are some ways God speaks to His people?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Jesus said, “My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me” (John 10:27). In the book of Romans, the apostle Paul says, \"For all who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God\" (Romans 8:14). The Bible says, \"Your own ears will hear him. Right behind you a voice will say, 'This is the way you should go,' whether to the right or to the left\" (Isaiah 30:21). There are basically seven ways that God speaks to His people today. The first and most important way is through the Scriptures. The Bible is the standard that we use to judge every other form of what we believe to be God's guidance. The second way God communicates is by His Spirit speaking directly to our spirit. This can be through the still small voice that we hear in our heart, through a dream, or through a vision. Because this revelation is supernatural, it's important to confirm that what you believe you are hearing is truly from God. This leads us to the next way God directs, and that is through confirmation. The Bible says, \"The facts of every case must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses\" (2 Corinthians 13:1b). God will speak to us, and then He gives us the other six keys to hearing His voice in order to confirm that what he has said is truly from Him. The next key is godly counsel. The Bible says, “[T]here is safety in having many advisers” (Proverbs 11:14b). God is not offended if we seek confirmation through our pastor, our parents, our teachers, or through mature godly friends. In fact, He is blessed when we seek to confirm his guidance in our lives. Another important key to hearing God's voice is through the peace of God. The Bible says, “You shall go out in joy and be led forth in peace” (Isaiah 55:12a). It also says, “[L]et the peace that comes from Christ rule in your hearts” (Colossians 3:15a). The word “rule” here in the Greek is the same word for an umpire. So the peace of God is like an umpire that tells us whether we are “safe” in His will or “out” of His will. The next key to hearing God's voice is personal prophecy. God will use New Testament prophets to speak His will to us – and also to confirm His will in our lives. Scripture says in the book of Amos, \"Indeed, the Sovereign LORD never does anything until he reveals his plans to his servants the prophets\" (Amos 3:7). The apostle Paul tells us that we should be eager to prophesy because God builds up His church through this special gift of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 14:39). But remember, New Testament prophecy is meant for edification, exhortation, and comfort (1 Corinthians 14:3). It is never meant for judgment. The final way that God will speak to us is through circumstances. Some people rely too much on circumstances, neglecting the other six keys of God's guidance. Other people don't pay enough attention to the circumstances and sometimes step out ahead of God's timing, even though they may have actually heard God's voice in a certain direction. So we need to weigh the circumstances along with the other six keys of God's guidance. The wonderful thing to know is that because God loves you He is communicating – and you can hear His voice and know His will today."}]}

He heard me from his sanctuary; my cry to him reached his ears\" (Psalms 18:6). The following passages also speak to God's desire to protect His people: “The LORD keeps you from all harm and watches over your life” (Psalms 121:7). The famous Psalm 91 speaks of God's protection for those who love Him. In verse 10, He promises, “[N]o evil will conquer you; no plague will come near your home.” If you find yourself in trouble, call out to Jesus for protection.

The question to Simon Peter concerned relationship – then the command to care for the sheep concerned task. When we disobey and fall into sin, God wants to restore us both to heal the relationship and also to keep us on target to complete our calling. And the wonderful news is that He is quick to forgive and restore when we repent. Scripture tells us, \"If we confess our sins to him, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all wickedness\" (1 John 1:9).

Aren't they the ones who will inherit the Kingdom he promised to those who love him?\" (James 2:5). God will often work through people, groups, and nations that appear weak so that when He accomplishes His plan, no one can take credit for it. It could have only been done because of God."}]}

God is not angry with you. The Bible says, “For God made Christ, who never sinned, to be the offering for our sin, so that we could be made right with God through Christ\" (2 Corinthians 5:21). Because Jesus took sin upon Himself on the cross, every believer who accepts Jesus Christ as his or her Lord and Savior becomes a child of God. The Apostle John writes, “But to all who believed him and accepted him, he gave the right to become children of God.” Romans 10:9 says, \"If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.\" By confessing Jesus as Lord and believing in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you become a part of the family of God – and there is nothing you can do to make God not want you to be in this family (Romans 8:15). Because we are human, we all make mistakes and sin from time to time (Romans 3:23). You need to understand that this sin makes God sad, but He is not angry with you. God is sad because he knows that sin can harm you (Romans 6:23), and He does not want any harm to come to you. So when we sin, it is important that we quickly ask God to forgive us (1 John 1:9) and to cleanse us from all of our sins, both the ones we remember and even the ones we may have forgotten about. Saying we're sorry to God for our sins is called repentance. The word “repent” in the Greek literally means to \"change your mind.\" So when we repent for our sins, we are saying sorry to God, and we are promising that, by His grace and with His help, we will not do bad things anymore. But even if we sin again, we need to understand that God loves us. He's our Heavenly Father, and He wants us to ask for forgiveness so that He can bless us and protect us from any plans of the devil. God's love and forgiveness for us through Jesus sacrifice on the cross is one of the reasons why the Gospel is such Good News."}]}

Naaman was a warrior who won many battles for his king and his country. So his king, his soldiers, and the people of Syria heaped praise upon him. He was accustomed to being in charge and to giving the orders. So when he came before the man of God, he had difficulty humbling himself in obedience to the Lord's instructions. In fact, he almost lost out on his healing because he did not want to follow the instructions of Elisha to bathe in the Jordan River. He declared that the rivers in Damascus were cleaner than any river in Israel. But he listened to the advice of his captains, humbled himself, and obeyed the word of the Lord -- and thus received his healing. When we come before the Lord in our time of prayer, it's important for us to humble ourselves like Naaman did to receive favor from God. Scripture says that we can come before the throne of grace to receive mercy and favor in our time of need. But this only can happen if we are willing to humble ourselves and recognize that Jesus is Lord and that we are His servants."}]}

The first is when He is with Peter, James, and John on the Mount of Transfiguration. It says that His face \"shone like the sun\" or, put another way, that “sunlight poured from his face.\" It says that His clothes were so bright and white that Peter, James, and John couldn't look at him. The second passage is in the book of Revelation, and it describes Jesus in a similar way. It says that He was dressed in a long robe with a gold sash wrapped around His chest. And it says that His hair was white as snow, and His eyes were like a fiery flame. And His voice sounded like rushing waters. John was so overwhelmed that John fell on his face. It was just too much to be in Jesus' presence. But Jesus said to him, \"Don't be afraid\" (Revelation 1:17). But we can understand why John was afraid.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "How can I grow as a Christian?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the same way that a baby grows and matures, so a Christian needs to grow and mature. There are four main things that a child of God needs to do in order to grow spiritually: 1. Read the Bible 2. Pray 3. Meet with others Christians (have fellowship) 4. Tell others about Jesus (witness) It's like a car that needs four pumped up tires to be able to drive well on a road. 1. Read the Bible (in the Old Testament, the Bible is referred to as the Law of the Lord) Psalm 1:2,3 - But they delight in the law of the LORD, meditating on it day and night. They are like trees planted along the riverbank, bearing fruit each season. Their leaves never wither, and they prosper in all they do. a) The Bible helps us to grow as Christians -- just like milk helps a baby to grow. 1 Peter 2:2 - You must crave pure spiritual milk so that you can grow into the fullness of your salvation. Cry out for this nourishment as a baby cries for milk. b) The Bible is like a guidebook on how God wants us to live. Psalm 119:9 - How can a young person stay pure? By obeying your word and following its rules. Psalm 119:11 - I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you. Psalm 119:105 - Your word is a lamp for my feet and a light for my path. c) The Bible is part of the spiritual armor that helps us to fight against the attacks of the devil. Ephesians 6:17 - Take the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God. Matthew 4:10 - \"Get out of here, Satan,\" Jesus told him. \"For the Scriptures say...,\" 2. Pray Why should I pray? a) Praying is talking to God. When you love someone you want to talk to them. Prayer is a two-way conversation that helps us to grow in our relationship with God. Through prayer, we talk to God and He talks to us. You can talk to God about everything: what's happening in your life, how you feel, what you need. Philippians 4:6 - Don't worry about anything; instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need, and thank him for all he has done. b) Jesus showed us that it was important to pray. Luke 6:12 - One day soon afterward Jesus went up on a mountain to pray, and he prayed to God all night. c) When should I pray? You can pray as often as you can, at any time, about anything and everything. 1 Thessalonians 5:17 - Never stop praying. d)Where should I pray? You can pray to God anywhere. Remember Jonah? He was in the belly of a great fish when he prayed! e) How should I pray? Jesus taught us how to pray when he gave us the Lord's Prayer. The letters of the word ACTS helps us to remember the different aspects of prayer: A - Adoration. Praise God and talk about the wonderful things He has done. C - Confess. Confess your sin to God. Tell Him about the things you have done (and those that you should not have done) as well as the things you haven't done (and should have done). Talk to God about your wrong thoughts and wrong attitudes as well. T - Thanks. Thank God for forgiving you and for all His blessings. S - Supplication. This word means 'to ask'. Ask God for what you, and other people, need. 3. Fellowship Meet with other Christians regularly - go to church or Sunday school. Perhaps you could join a Bible club, youth group, or go to a Christian camp. Acts 2:42 - They joined with the other believers and devoted themselves to the apostle's teaching and fellowship, sharing in the Lord's Supper and in prayer. Acts 2:44 - And all the believers met together in one place and shared everything they had. 4. Witness. Tell others about how God loves them so much that he sent Jesus to die so that, if they believe on Him and accept Him as Savior, they can be forgiven and have eternal life. John 3:16 - For God loved the world so much that he gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life. Mark 5:19 - But Jesus said, \"No, go home to your friends, and tell them what wonderful things the Lord has done for you and how merciful he has been."}]}

This was far from the truth. God's orders were to completely destroy the evil Amalekites who had opposed the Israelites when they left Egypt. Instead, Saul chose to spare the king's life, and keep the best animals, and valuable objects for himself. He only destroyed what was worthless (1 Samuel 15:8-9). Samuel confronted Saul with his sin. Saul denied that He had done anything wrong. He told Samuel that he completed the mission God gave him. \"But I did obey the LORD,” Saul insisted. “I carried out the mission he gave me. I brought back King Agag, but I destroyed everyone else. Then my troops brought in the best of the sheep, goats, cattle, and plunder to sacrifice to the LORD your God in Gilgal.” (1 Samuel 15:20-21). Sin cannot be hidden from God. Because Saul continued to disobey God and would not repent, God rejected Saul and removed his kingdom from him. God will not be mocked! 1 John 1:8-9 says, \"If we claim we have no sin, we are only fooling ourselves and not living in the truth. But if we confess our sins to him, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all wickedness.\" When we make excuses for our sin, we fool ourselves, not God. If we will confess our sins - if we admit that we have sinned and have offended God - He will forgive us and cleanse us! God sent the prophet Nathan to King David to reveal David's secret sin. David had successfully hidden his sin from others, but God knew! When Nathan revealed the sin to David, David was heartbroken and repented of his sin. He asked God for His mercy and forgiveness. \"Have mercy on me, O God, because of your unfailing love. Because of your great compassion, blot out the stain of my sins. Wash me clean from my guilt. Purify me from my sin. For I recognize my rebellion; it haunts me day and night. Against you, and you alone, have I sinned; I have done what is evil in your sight. You will be proved right in what you say, and your judgment against me is just.\" (Psalm 51:1-4). This is the correct response to sin. It is right to apologize to others we have sinned against, but don't forget that God has been offended and sinned against too! David recognized and understood how he had fallen short of God's Word. In contrast, Saul didn't make the connection; he was in denial and fooling himself. We must never try to hide our sin. Always come to God and confess your sin; repent and ask God to cleanse and forgive you! He is faithful to do it every time!"}]}

He risked his own life by stopping to help the injured man. The bandits could have been hiding and waiting for someone to stop to help so they could attack again. Then he used his own oil, wine, and bandages to care for the man's wounds. He placed the man on his own donkey and brought him to the inn. He wasn't done yet! He paid the innkeeper what amounted to about two day's wages at that time. The next day, he promised to pay the innkeeper for any additional expenses needed to care for the man until he was well! What an example Jesus gave to us of generously caring for our neighbor. What the Samaritan did was for a friend or fellow Samaritan; yet, he did all of this for his despised Jewish enemy! (Luke 10:25-37). Are we generous like the Samaritan? Or, do we try to give the least amount of time, effort, or money to a need or request? What is our attitude when we give or help? Are we cheerful and eager to give? Or, do we do it grudgingly and complain as we do it? 2 Corinthians 9:7-9 says, “You must each decide in your heart how much to give. And don't give reluctantly or in response to pressure. “For God loves a person who gives cheerfully.” And God will generously provide all you need. Then you will always have everything you need and plenty left over to share with others. As the Scriptures say, “They share freely and give generously to the poor. Their good deeds will be remembered forever.” God's response to our generosity is to be generous with us! He will give us all we need and even more to share with others! We love and serve a generous God. How generous? He sent His only Son to die for our sin so that we might live with Him forever! When we are connected to Christ, God generously blesses our lives. “All praise to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms because we are united with Christ.” (Ephesians 1:3)."}]}

God had previously told Elijah to anoint Elisha to replace him as God's prophet. (1 Kings 19:16, 19-21). So, this was not an arrogant request from Elisha. Elisha's request showed his desire was to continue in Elijah's footsteps! Elisha did not ask for earthly power, fame, or wealth. Instead, he asked for spiritual power to do God's work (2 Kings 2:9). Elisha picked up Elijah's cloak and divided the Jordan River. His request had been granted!

Here is what the apostle Paul wrote on this subject in 1 Corinthians 8:4b-6: “Well, we all know that an idol is not really a god and that there is only one God. There may be so-called gods both in heaven and on earth, and some people actually worship many gods and many lords. But we know that there is only one God, the Father, who created everything, and we live for Him. And there is only one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom God made everything and through whom we have been given life.” Yes, every other so-called god is man-made. There is only one God Who created all that we see from nothing! He is the source of life and He gives us the very breath that we breathe! The apostle Paul in Acts 17: 23-25 was dealing with people who worshiped many other gods. One of their gods didn't even have a name! Paul talked to them about the one true God, the creator of life. “For as I was walking along I saw your many shrines. And one of your altars had this inscription on it: 'To an Unknown God.' This God, whom you worship without knowing, is the one I'm telling you about. He is the God who made the world and everything in it. Since He is Lord of heaven and earth, He doesn't live in man-made temples, and human hands can't serve His needs—for He has no needs. He himself gives life and breath to everything, and He satisfies every need.” God does not want to share our worship with any false god! On Mount Carmel, the false prophets prayed to their idols which were silent. Their idols were not real and they could not receive or respond to the worship of the prophets. God immediately responded to Elijah's prayer on Mount Carmel to prove that God was the one true God of Israel! He sent fire from heaven that burnt up the altar.

Sometime later, Jezebel had an innocent man named Naboth killed so Ahab could take ownership of his property. Though it seemed like Ahab and Jezebel had gotten away with many evil, wicked deeds, it was soon time to reap what they had sown. God sent Elijah to tell him that God was about to punish not only him, but his family too – including Jezebel! They would all experience painful deaths. Elijah's prophecy of God's judgment came true.

This is how it seemed to Elijah who told God that he was the only prophet left! God told Elijah there were 7,000 others who served Him that had never bowed down to Baal. God knows all those who serve Him and are obedient to His Word. He also sees those who choose to do evil and rebel against Him. (1 Kings 19:10-18).

We also need to spend time in God's presence to renew our strength. Galatians 6:7-9 says, “Don't be misled—you cannot mock the justice of God. You will always harvest what you plant. Those who live only to satisfy their own sinful nature will harvest decay and death from that sinful nature. But those who live to please the Spirit will harvest everlasting life from the Spirit. So let's not get tired of doing what is good. At just the right time we will reap a harvest of blessing if we don't give up.” Everyone will reap what they have sown whether it is evil or good! This is not the time to give up; there is a harvest of blessing coming to those who sow righteousness!"}]}

When Elijah asked them to choose who they would follow, Baal or the one true God, they were silent. Did they really not know the truth? The Bible tells us that there are many false prophets in this world. 1 John 4:1-2 says: “Dear friends, do not believe everyone who claims to speak by the Spirit. You must test them to see if the spirit they have comes from God. For there are many false prophets in the world. By this you know the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God.” We are told to test every spirit. To do this we need the Holy Spirit to help us discern truth from falsehood. The good news is that the Holy Spirit lives inside every born again believer of Jesus. He can help us no matter where we are or what we are doing. Jesus sent Him to lead us into all truth! “When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all truth. He will not speak on his own but will tell you what he has heard. He will tell you about the future.” (John 16:13). We also are to determine if words spoken or taught agree with God's Word. If not, we must reject those words! The Bible says this about prophecies, “But test everything that is said. Hold on to what is good. Stay away from every kind of evil.” (1 Thessalonians 5:21-22). Thankfully, we have the power and wisdom of the Holy Spirit in us. We must allow the Spirit of truth to speak to us before we accept something as God's truth."}]}

Sometimes, when people choose to do bad things, innocent people can get hurt. That is why it is important that we do the right thing all the time. The book of James teaches us, \"Dear brothers and sisters, when troubles come your way, consider it an opportunity for great joy. For you know that when your faith is tested, your endurance has a chance to grow\" (James 1:2-3). We live in a sinful world where some people do bad things to other people. But if we put our trust in God and forgive those who hurt us, the Lord can turn bad things to good in our lives. The Apostle Paul tells us, \"And we know that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to his purpose for them\" (Romans 8:28)."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Joshua heard God's voice. How can you hear God's voice and do what He wants you to do in life?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "God wants us to be fulfilled, blessed, and successful in what He has planned for our lives. He also wants us to be a reflection of His love and a blessing in the Earth. In Jeremiah 29:11, the Lord makes clear His intentions for you and me: \"'For I know the plans I have for you,' says the Lord. 'They are plans for good and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope.'\" We read in Genesis 3:8: \"When the cool evening breezes were blowing, the man and his wife heard the Lord God walking about in the garden. So they hid from the Lord God among the trees.\" This is how God wants to relate to us today, as well. It is God's desire to walk with and to communicate with His children. He wants to talk to us. And He wants us to listen and talk to Him. There is more good news: we can hear His voice. The Bible makes it clear that we were created to have two-way communication with Him. Jesus tells us in John 10:27, \"My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me.\" The prophet Isaiah says, \"Your own ears will hear him. Right behind you a voice will say, 'This is the way you should go,' whether to the right or to the left\" (Isaiah 30:21). You can hear God's voice by reading the Bible, through listening to your parents, and by going to church, and listening to your pastor or Sunday School teacher. As you get older, you will learn how to know God's voice from the other voices you may hear. God's voice can come with peace you will feel in your heart. In the Old Testament, a boy named Samuel thought that Eli was speaking to him when it really was God (1 Samuel 3:7-8). He had to learn to identify God's voice. But after some practice, he became one of the greatest prophets in the whole Bible. As you practice hearing God's voice, you will find that you too can identify it so that you can do all God calls for you to do."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is the right way to respond when God asks you to do something for Him?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Jesus is our model for how to respond to God's direction for our lives. He told His disciples, \"I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself. He does only what he sees the Father doing. Whatever the Father does, the Son also does\" (John 5:19). When faced with death on the cross and separation from His Father for the first and only time, Jesus willingly obeyed His Father's will. In the Garden of Gethsemane, he declared, \"Father, if you are willing, please take this cup of suffering away from me. Yet I want your will to be done, not mine\" (Luke 22:42). It is okay to ask God to confirm His will for our lives. But once we are sure of God's direction, we need to follow the leading of Jesus in obedience, declaring, \"Not my will, but Yours be done.\""}]}

There are some things we can't understand very well.  But we know that they are true nonetheless.  Many things that are true can be difficult for us to understand. Just think about the idea that God is infinite or the idea that He created the whole universe out of nothing! Both are true, but to really understand them is a tall order! The doctrine of the Trinity is just like that. \n<br><br>\nWhile not perfect, a good way to imagine how the Trinity works is to consider how water can exist in three forms.
