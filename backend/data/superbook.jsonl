{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Why isn't there more ethnic diversity in the Superbook videos?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As you know, God loves all the people of the world (John 3:16), and Jesus commanded His disciples to take the good news to every distinct people group in the world (Matthew 28:19). What's more, people of every nation, tribe, and language will be in heaven (Revelation 7:9). With these truths in mind, the staff of Superbook is dedicated to including an ethnically diverse group of children in the Superbook episodes. You can see more diversity in a few episodes of Season One, and you will notice much more diversity in the subsequent seasons."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Satan is shown in several Superbook episodes. Why is he depicted as a flying serpent with wings and a tail?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Bible doesn't specifically describe Satan, who is also called Lucifer or the devil; so we used creative license to show what he may look like. In the episode “In the Beginning,” when Lucifer is first shown as an angel in heaven, he is depicted as a beautiful creature with long blond hair. When he rebels against God, he is transformed into an evil creature, and his flowing hair becomes horns. Also, his body becomes reptile-like in appearance, assuming the look of the serpent in the Garden of Eden. (See Genesis 3:1.) We did not want to create Satan to look like a character that could be construed as a cool villain. We want children to understand that there is a real enemy, and he is evil."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "How could David kill a lion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The power of God came on David and gave him the courage and strength to kill a lion. Another time, David killed a bear (1 Samuel 17:34-37)."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Why did God choose a young boy like David to be the future king of Israel?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "God looked at David's heart and saw that he had a desire to obey and please Him (1 Samuel 13:14; 16:7)."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Why did Samuel pour oil on David's head?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The pouring of oil on David's head by the prophet Samuel showed that God had set him apart for special service. In other words, God had selected him as the future king of Israel. In addition, the oil symbolized the Holy Spirit. The Bible records that when Samuel poured the oil on David's head that the Holy Spirit came powerfully on David from that day on (1 Samuel 16:13)."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "What kind of musical instrument did David play?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "David played a small harp or lyre."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Who was the man taunting the Israelites, and why do you show him speaking some of the things that Goliath said in the Bible?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In order to avoid the possibility of scaring some children with Goliath's prolonged and menacing presence, we created a Philistine man named Phicol to provide comic relief."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "How tall was Goliath?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Bible records that Goliath was over nine feet tall (1 Samuel 17:4)."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Why does the episode \"A Giant Adventure\" only show David picking up one stone instead of five?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "While the Bible does record that David picked up five stones, we focused on the central point of the story in that, through faith in God and with God's power, David defeated Goliath with a sling and a stone. Due to time limitations, we are not always able to show all of the details of a biblical story. All of the Superbook episodes are limited to about 28 minutes in length so they can be broadcast in 30-minute time slots. (This will enable us to take Superbook to many more children in the United States and around the world.) When you take into account the opening and closing songs as well as the end credits, we only have about 22 minutes to tell the whole story. Part of that time is allotted to Chris and Joy in their modern-day setting so kids can learn an important and relevant life lesson. As you can see, we simply do not have enough time to cover every aspect of the biblical stories. It is our hope and desire that the adventures of Chris and Joy will inspire children to find out more about the stories. One of the goals of the Superbook series is to get children excited about reading the Bible."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "What was the golden glow that was on David when he was about to fight Goliath?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The glow shows the Spirit of the Lord that came on David to enable him to defeat Goliath (1 Samuel 16:13 NLT)."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Did David kill Goliath with the sling or the sword?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Bible records that David defeated Goliath with a stone and a sling. After Goliath fell to the ground, David took Goliath's sword and killed him (1 Samuel 17:49-51)."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Why doesn't the episode \"In the Beginning\" show that there were six separate days of creation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "God's wonderful creative acts were shown briefly in an overview. Time limitations prevented us from showing the days of creation in more detail."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Before Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit, why didn't the lion attack the people or animals?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Before Adam and Eve sinned, the Garden of Eden was an unspoiled paradise. God had given Adam and Eve dominion over the earth, and animals did not attack people. Many Bible scholars believe that before Adam and Eve sinned, all animals were vegetarians."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "In the battle that was shown, why was Michael's sword flaming?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We used creative license to show Michael with a flaming sword that is reminiscent of the flaming sword that kept Adam and Eve out of the Garden of Eden. The Bible records, After sending them out, the LORD God stationed mighty cherubim to the east of the Garden of Eden. And he placed a flaming sword that flashed back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life (Genesis 3:24 NLT)."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Why is Satan shown as Lucifer during the rebellion in heaven?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Many Bible scholars believe that Satan used to be a mighty angel called Lucifer. But when he rebelled against God, he became corrupted and evil. The Bible tells us, How you are fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! How you are cut down to the ground, you who weakened the nations! (Isaiah 14:12 NKJV)."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Who were the bad angels?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The evil angels were the ones that Satan convinced to join his rebellion and be part of his demonic army. This is symbolically referred to in the book of Revelation, with Satan referred to as a dragon and the angels referred to as stars of heaven: And another sign appeared in heaven: behold, a great, fiery red dragon having seven heads and ten horns, and seven diadems on his heads. His tail drew a third of the stars of heaven and threw them to the earth (Revelation 12:3-4 NKJV)."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "What happens to the angels when they are struck in battle and disappear?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We used creative liberty to depict the battle between good angels and fallen angels. When an angel is struck down, it can no longer fight in the battle."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Why did Lucifer change in form to be so ugly? Doesn't he come \"as an angel of light\" to deceive us?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Lucifer's change in appearance was an outward reflection of how he had corrupted himself and become evil. On the other hand, he can try to deceive people by disguising himself as a good angel. The Bible tell us about Satan's deception when it says, But I am not surprised! Even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light (2 Corinthians 11:14 NLT)."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Was it Jesus or God the Father who walked in the Garden of Eden?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "God was the one walking majestically through the garden. We depicted Him as radiant and divine, and we showed Him exercising miraculous power. The Bible reveals that the Creator really did walk in the midst of His creation: And they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden (Genesis 3:8 NKJV)."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "When God spoke to Moses from the burning bush, why did He tell Moses to take off his sandals and that it was holy ground?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The ground where Moses stood became holy because of God's revealed presence. In eastern countries, it is customary to take off shoes and sandals when entering someplace special like a home. On a deeper level, Moses' sandals were dirty, and taking them off was an acknowledgement by Moses that he was sinful and was in the presence of the holy God."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "How could Pharaoh's court magicians turn their staffs into snakes?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Pharaoh's magicians used the powers of Satan to copy the miracle that occurred with Moses' staff. Moses did not have miraculous power; it was God who changed Moses' staff into a serpent and back into a staff."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Why didn't Pharaoh ride his chariot down between the parted waters of the Red Sea?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There were boulders in his way and his army was rushing past him, so he was blocked from going further."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Did Pharaoh die when the waters came back together?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Bible does not specifically say that Pharaoh died, so we do not know with certainty that he did drown. On the other hand, all of Pharaoh's army that chased the Israelites into the sea perished. The Bible records, Then the waters returned and covered all the chariots and charioteers–the entire army of Pharaoh. Of all the Egyptians who had chased the Israelites into the sea, not a single one survived (Exodus 14:28 NLT)."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Did the star of Bethlehem appear at the time of Jesus' birth or two years before? Did the magi arrive when Jesus was a newborn baby or when He was a young child?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Bible scholars are not in agreement as to the exact time when the star appeared and when the magi arrived. Some believe that the star appeared when Jesus was born, the magi then saw the star, began their journey, and arrived months or years later. Another view is that the star appeared before the birth of Christ, so the magi began their journey sooner and arrived when Jesus was born. \"The First Christmas\" shows the latter understanding of the events. This also allows children who have seen traditional nativity scenes to be able to relate well to the nativity scene in \"The First Christmas.\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Was Jesus born in a wooden stable or cave?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Bible tells us that Jesus was placed in a manger, which is a feeding trough for animals. The Gospel of Luke records, She gave birth to her first child, a son. She wrapped him snugly in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger, because there was no lodging available for them (Luke 2:7 NLT). On the other hand, the Bible does not tell us if the manger was in a stable or cave. \"The First Christmas\" follows the traditional view of Jesus being born in a wooden stable. This allows for children who have seen traditional nativity scenes to be able to relate well to the nativity scene in \"The First Christmas.\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Where was the host of angels that appeared to the shepherds and sang glory to God?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you look closely, you will see a multitude of angels singing in the clouds."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Did angels really appear in and above the stable when Jesus was born?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We know that angels appeared to the shepherds who were nearby. Although the Bible does not say that angels were there with Joseph, Mary, and Jesus, certainly God would have sent angels there to guard the newborn baby, even if they were not visible to the people there. A psalm speaks of God's angelic protection: If you make the LORD your refuge, if you make the Most High your shelter, no evil will conquer you; no plague will come near your home. For he will order his angels to protect you wherever you go. They will hold you up with their hands so you won't even hurt your foot on a stone (Psalm 91:9-12 NLT). In addition, we exercised creative liberty to produce a majestic visualization of the spiritual realm when the Savior was born."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Where was the ancient city of Babylon?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The city of Babylon was in the area that is now called the nation of Iraq. In the Old Testament, \"Babylon\" refers to both the city of Babylon and the region of Babylonia."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Did Daniel and King Darius live around the same time as Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego, and King Nebuchadnezzar?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego were all taken as captives to Babylon when King Nebuchadnezzar conquered Jerusalem. Because of his great God-given wisdom, Daniel served in important governmental positions under a series of kings: Nebuchadnezzar, Belshazzar, and Darius."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "What was the seal put on the rock that covered the lions' den?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To keep people from attempting to move the stone to rescue Daniel, some clay was pressed against the stone and the covering of the lions' den. The king then pressed image on his ring against the clay to leave an impression in it. This was the royal seal of the king and meant that no one was to tamper with it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Why would Abraham sacrifice a lamb or ram?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "God Himself instituted the practice of animal sacrifice for the sins of people. After Adam and Eve sinned, God made clothing for them from animal skins. Much later, when God gave the Old Covenant Law to the people of Israel, He gave instructions for the sacrifice of certain animals as offerings for sin. The Bible tells us, In fact, according to the law of Moses, nearly everything was purified with blood. For without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness (Hebrews 9:22 NLT). The animal that was sacrificed had to be without any defect. This points to the sinlessness of Jesus Christ who died for the sins of mankind. The innocence of the lamb sacrificed by Abraham foreshadows the innocence of Jesus. Now that Jesus has died for the sins of the world, animal sacrifices are no longer needed."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "What were the images in the smoke of the burnt offering?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "They were highlights of Abraham's future, including joyful moments with his wife Sara and his son Isaac, as well as a very troubling time when God would tell Abraham to offer Isaac as a sacrifice."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "What was the counting instrument that Isaac had?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It was an abacus–a device for performing mathematical calculations by sliding balls or beads along rods or in grooves."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "When Abraham recounts the time he had three visitors, why did you show Jesus as being one of them?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The account of this extraordinary visit clearly reveals that the Lord was visiting Abraham. The Bible explicitly says that the Lord visited and spoke to Abraham. The Hebrew word translated as \"Lord\" is \"Yahweh,\" God's holy name. Theologians believe that when God appeared in bodily form in Old Testament times that it was an appearance of Jesus."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "What did God mean when He told Abraham, And through your descendants all the nations of the earth will be blessed–all because you have obeyed me?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "God was foretelling the birth of His Son, Jesus Christ. In the human sense, Jesus would be a descendant of Abraham and Isaac. Through Jesus, people around the world can experience God's wonderful blessings of love, grace, mercy, and forgiveness."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Why does the first part of the episode \"The Road to Damascus\" show Ananias in Jerusalem? Didn't he live in Damascus?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ananias said that the people with him should go to his home in Damascus, so he was only visiting the believers in Jerusalem. The Bible tells us, Now there was a believer in Damascus named Ananias (Acts 9:10 NLT). On the other hand, due to the intense persecution of Christians in Jerusalem, most of the believers who lived there fled the city."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Why did you show Stephen being stoned?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We showed part of the stoning so we could be as historically accurate as possible about Saul's previous actions and the persecution that occurred. However, we only showed the stoning as a black and white memory in order to diminish the scene's intensity and make it more suitable for children."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "On the road to Damascus, why did Saul's companions fall off their horses when the Bible says that the others stood speechless?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We used creative license to emphasize the fact that the men with Saul were so amazed or fearful that they did not say anything. The Bible records how much they were struck by the events, The men with Saul stood speechless, for they heard the sound of someone's voice but saw no one! (Acts 9:7 NLT)."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Why did Jesus say that Saul was persecuting Him? Since Jesus was in heaven, how could He be persecuted?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When Jesus was still on earth, He taught that whatever is done to someone who believes in Him is also done to Him. In one of Jesus' parables, the King says, I tell you the truth, when you did it to one of the least of these my brothers and sisters, you were doing it to me! (Matthew 25:40 NLT). When Saul was persecuting Christians, it was as if He was doing it to Jesus because the Lord lives in their hearts and they are so precious to Him."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "When Jesus spoke from heaven, why did Joy say, \"It sounds like thunder!\"?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Bible tells us that the men with Saul heard the sound of someone's voice (Acts 9:7 NLT). It might have been similar to when Jesus was on the cross and the Father spoke from heaven, I have already brought glory to my name, and I will do so again (John 12:28 NLT). The crowd heard the voice, but some confused it with thunder or the voice of an angel. The Bible tells us, When the crowd heard the voice, some thought it was thunder, while others declared an angel had spoken to him (John 12:29 NLT)."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Why did Ananias put a covering on his head when he prayed?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In Israel, it was traditional for Jewish men to put a prayer shawl (tallit) on their heads when they said their morning prayers."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "When Ananias prayed, \"Barukh ata Adonia Eloheinu melekh ha-olam,\" what did it mean?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It was the first part of a traditional Jewish opening prayer. It means, \"Blessed are You, LORD, our God, King of the universe…\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Why did Moses tell them to only collect enough manna for one day?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "God commanded this to teach the people to trust in His daily provision. They could rest in the knowledge that God was watching over them every day and would provide what was needed for each day."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Why does God appear to Moses at one time as a fire, and another time as a light swirling around him?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We know that God has manifested Himself to people in various ways. He spoke to Moses from the burning bush (Exodus 3:2) and a cloud (Exodus 34:5), the Holy Spirit descended upon Jesus as a dove (John 1:32), and on the day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit came with the sound of a rushing wind and tongues of fire (Acts 2:1-4)."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Toward the end of the episode \"The Ten Commandments\", when Moses was praying by himself on the mountain, what was it that came down by him?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It was the Lord coming down in the form of a cloud. The Bible tells us, Then the LORD came down in a cloud and stood there with him; and he called out his own name, Yahweh (Exodus 34:5 NLT)."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "What age group is \"Miracles of Jesus\" intended for?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Superbook episodes are generally produced for children from 5 to 12 years of age. However, because children differ in their spiritual development, sensitivity to dramatic depictions, and the type of programming they are accustomed to viewing, we suggest that parents consider which episodes are appropriate for each of their children. For some episodes, we advise parents to preview the episode before showing it to their children."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Why does a man in the crowd turn into Satan in episode \"Miracles of Jesus\"?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the script for this episode, the man is called \"The Naysayer.\" He represents doubt, mockery, and lies. John 8:44 tells us that the devil is \"the father of lies.\" Since the beginning, Satan has been an expert at deception and confusion. As an example, he transformed himself into a serpent in the Garden of Eden."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Why does Satan appear in the storm? Was he causing it?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Satan did not cause the storm, and his remarks reveal that he did not. In the episode we purposely had the storm begin to develop before Satan appeared. Also, the Bible does not say that Satan caused the storm. However, Matthew 8:26 tells us that Jesus \"rebuked\" the wind and the waves, and they became still. In other places in the Gospel, the word \"rebuke\" is used when Jesus takes authority over demonic power. (See Matthew 17:18, Mark 9:25, and Luke 9:42.) We used creative license to illustrate how the disciples did not display faith in God as they reacted to the chaos of the storm and their fear of drowning."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Why is the demon-possessed man in the Gadarene tombs so scary looking, and why does his voice sound so strange?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "His voice sounds as if many people are speaking because he had so many evil spirits. Luke 8:31-32 refers to \"the demons\" (plural) speaking to Jesus. The Bible describes the demon-possessed man very graphically in both Mark 5:1-20 and Luke 8:26-39."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "At the end of \"Miracles of Jesus,\" we see how Miraculo was able to \"levitate\" using a hidden wire, and we know that many magicians use smoke and mirrors to make objects like park benches \"disappear.\" But how did Miraculo get Chris's cell phone to \"fly\" out of his pocket?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In order to accomplish an illusion like this, Street magicians often use accomplices to secretly rig unsuspecting bystanders."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Why did Gizmo say that the word \"Messiah\" means \"the Chosen One\" instead of the \"Anointed One\"?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The word \"Messiah\" is often translated simply as \"Anointed One.\" Jesus certainly was anointed by God, for He said, The Spirit of the LORD is upon me, for he has anointed me to bring Good News to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim that captives will be released, that the blind will see, that the oppressed will be set free, and that the time of the LORD's favor has come (Luke 4:18-19 NLT). But Jesus' title as \"Messiah\" has a deeper and fuller meaning. He was anointed as prophet, priest, and king! Still, He did not come as the kind of king the people expected, for He said to Pilate, \"My Kingdom is not an earthly kingdom. If it were, my followers would fight to keep me from being handed over to the Jewish leaders. But my Kingdom is not of this world\" (John 18:36 NLT). Jesus is King of the kingdom of God!"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "What does \"Hosannah\" mean?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It is a Hebrew word that means, \"Save us, we implore you!\" It was an exclamation of praise by the people when Jesus entered Jerusalem. It reflects the words of Psalm 118:25, \"Please, LORD, please save us. Please, LORD, please give us success\" (NLT)."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "What does \"Baruch Haba B'Shem Adonai\" mean?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It is Hebrew, and it means, \"Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord.\" This shout of the people hailed Jesus as the promised Messiah, and reflects Psalm 118:26, \"Bless the one who comes in the name of the LORD. We bless you from the house of the LORD\" (NLT)."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Why did Jesus ride on a donkey?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Jesus was fulfilling one of the prophecies about the Messiah. This prophecy said, Tell the people of Jerusalem, 'Look, your King is coming to you. He is humble, riding on a donkey— riding on a donkey's colt' (Matthew 21:5 NLT)."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Why did they wave palm branches?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the people waved palm branches to hail Him as the Messiah. The palm branches were waved as symbols of victory. In the ancient world, palm branches were used to welcome a king or victorious generals."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Why did Nahshon keep warning the Roman soldier about Jesus?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Nahshon was a character we created as a Pharisee. He represents the malevolent attitude and intentions of many of the religious leaders. For instance, the Bible records that the religious leaders planned to kill Jesus: It was now two days before Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The leading priests and the teachers of religious law were still looking for an opportunity to capture Jesus secretly and kill him (Mark 14:1 NLT)."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Why did Jesus look angry when He was clearing out the Temple?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The outer courts of the Temple were supposed to be a holy place of prayer for people of all nations, but Jesus saw that some people had turned it into a place of dishonest business."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "At the end of the Passover meal, why did Jesus say, \"This is the day that the Lord has made. Let us rejoice and be glad in it\"?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It was traditional for Psalm 118 to be sung during the Passover meal. One line from the psalm says, \"This is the day the LORD has made. We will rejoice and be glad in it\" (Psalm 118:24 NLT). The Gospel of Matthew tells us that Jesus and His disciples sang a hymn at the end of the meal, \"Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives\" (Matthew 26:30 NLT)."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can you tell me more about the birthright? Was the birthright just a tradition or was it commanded by God?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The birthright was a common practice in which the eldest son would receive a double share of the inheritance from his father. The oldest son also became the priest of the family, and he inherited the judicial authority of his father. In the Law given by God to the nation of Israel, the birthright of an oldest son is protected so that a father could not give it to a younger, but favored, son."}]}

Why did God say this?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "While the two sons were still in the womb, God knew the characteristics of each of them as well as that of the nations that would come from them.

These versions of the Bible use the word LORD to refer to the God of Israel, indicating His covenant name, Yahweh. As an example, the New Living Translation says, Then Elijah stood in front of them and said, \"How much longer will you waver, hobbling between two opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him! But if Baal is God, then follow him!\" (1 Kings 18:21)."}]}
