    "question": "What is the Law of Use as described in the parable of the talents?",
    "answer": "The Law of Use, as described in the parable of the talents, is a principle that emphasizes the importance of using and growing what has been given to us. In the parable, a nobleman gives his servants different amounts of money (talents) before he leaves for a journey. The servants who use their talents wisely and make a profit are rewarded when the nobleman returns, while the servant who hides his talent out of fear is reprimanded. This law suggests that God expects us to use and multiply the gifts, talents, and resources He has given us."

  {
    "question": "How does the Law of Use apply to our modern lives?",
    "answer": "The Law of Use applies to our modern lives in many ways. It encourages us to use and develop our talents, skills, and resources rather than letting them go to waste out of fear or complacency. This could apply to our careers, our finances, our relationships, and our spiritual growth. For example, if we have a talent for music, the Law of Use would encourage us to practice and develop that talent, rather than letting it go unused. Similarly, if we have been given financial resources, we are encouraged to invest and grow them, rather than hoarding or wasting them."

  {
    "question": "What does the parable of the talents teach us about God's expectations?",
    "answer": "The parable of the talents teaches us that God expects us to use and multiply the gifts, talents, and resources He has given us.

  {
    "question": "How does the Law of Use relate to personal growth and development?",
    "answer": " The Law of Use is a key principle in personal growth and development. It suggests that the more we use and develop our skills, talents, and resources, the more we will grow and improve.

  },
  {
    "question": "What is the exponential curve and how does it relate to the Law of Use?",
    "answer": " The exponential curve is a concept that describes how a quantity can grow rapidly when it is continually increased by a certain percentage. This concept is often used in finance to describe the power of compound interest, but it can also apply to many other areas of life. When combined with the Law of Use, the exponential curve suggests that the more we use and develop our talents, skills, and resources, the more they will grow and multiply. This can lead to rapid and dramatic growth and improvement over time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the parable of the talents teach us about using our gifts wisely?",
    "answer": "The parable of the talents teaches us the importance of using our gifts or resources wisely. In the story, two servants wisely use the funds given to them by their master, doubling the value through diligent trading and investment. When the master returns, he is pleased with their efforts and rewards them accordingly. In contrast, the third servant, afraid of risk and loss, buries the money and simply returns it untouched. The master criticizes his lack of initiative and gives his share to the more productive servant. This parable highlights how God expects us to use our resources, whether material or spiritual, for growth and development. When we take risks and use what we've been given wisely, we can expect God's blessing and approval. Not using our gifts and talents might deny us of potential rewards."

  {
    "question": "What does the book say about the concept of the Law of Use and the exponential curve in relation to money and growth?",
    "answer": "The book discusses the Law of Use, based on the parable of the talents, as a principle of individual and corporate growth and development. It states that the more one uses or applies what he has, the better his ability to use or increase it. The exponential curve, on the other hand, illustrates the enormous potential of compounded growth. The book suggests that together, they can create outstanding results over time. This is pointed out through compounded interest, business growth, and personal development. However, the book warns against the misuse or non-use of resources, as depicted in the parable, that could lead to potential loss or stagnation."

  },
  {
    "question": "What does the book say about the role of the Golden Rule in society?",

  },
  {
    "question": "How does the book suggest we could harness the power of the 'Law of Reciprocity' in our relationships?",
    "answer": "The book suggests we should apply gentleness in our interactions. People naturally respond positively to pleasant experiences and negatively to unpleasant ones.

  {
    "question": "What does the book suggest about the role of 'anticipatory tithing' under the Law of Reciprocity?",
    "answer": "The book introduces the concept of 'anticipatory tithing' as a way to harness the power of the Law of Reciprocity in our spiritual endeavors. This involves giving one-tenth of what one anticipates to receive. It stresses that giving should be based on the love for God and desire to help those in need. Giving with the expectation of receiving is not the goal, but one can trust that God will repay liberally as indicated in the Bible."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the Law of Reciprocity imply for business, particularly customer service?",
    "answer": "In business, and particularly customer service, the Law of Reciprocity implies that good service attracts customer loyalty and provides repeat business. Conversely, if a business cheats a customer, they may lose that customer's business forever. Consequently, businesses should be as kind and considerate in dealing with customers as they would want to be dealt with. This principle not only helps build strong relationships with customers but also fosters a positive company culture."
  },
  {
    "question": "The book mentions something called 'NIMBY'. What does this stand for and how does it relate to the Law of Reciprocity?",
    "answer": "'NIMBY' stands for 'not in my backyard'. It epitomizes the \"Golden Rule\" by implying that if you don't wish to have something displeasing or hazardous near your home or community, you shouldn't establish such things near others' communities. As such, it's a practical example of the Law of Reciprocity in the societal and environmental context."
  },
  {
    "question": "The book mentions a story about a man getting thirsty in the Rocky Mountains. What was the purpose of this story in relation to the Law of Reciprocity?",
    "answer": "The story from the Rocky Mountains was aimed to illustrate the principle of the Law of Reciprocity. The author drank from a stream without knowing that upstream, cattle were polluting the water. This is comparable to the effect of personal actions in communities and relationships - if we pollute our own environments or treat others badly, we inevitably end up consuming 'muddied waters' ourselves."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the relationship between 'The Golden Rule' and community zoning laws?",
    "answer": "According to the book, community zoning laws are practical applications of the 'Golden Rule'. Zoning laws dictate what can and cannot be built in specific areas, ensuring that activities or developments undertaken by one party do not detrimentally impact others in the community. This relates directly to the 'Golden Rule' by ensuring that individuals or organizations do not undertake actions that they themselves would not want to be subjected to."

  {
    "question": "What does the book suggest about the effects of recognizing and admitting our own faults?",
    "answer": "The book suggests that acknowledging and forsaking our own sins or mistakes can result in rich blessings.

This self-awareness and responsibility can lead to improvement in personal conduct and relationships, in line with the principles of the Law of Reciprocity."
  },
  {
    "question": "According to the book, how should the principle of 'every action has an equal and opposite reaction' apply to interpersonal relations?",
    "answer": "The book suggests that this principle should guide our interactions with others. As such, if we give off positive actions or attitudes, we are likely to receive the same. Conversely, if we give off negative actions or attitudes, we are likely to receive negative reactions in return. The application of this principle to interpersonal relations encourages us to be mindful of the way we treat others as it inevitably impacts the way we are treated in return."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the book explain Justifying God in Relation to the Law of Reciprocity?",
    "answer": "The book suggests that we tend to justify ourselves and blame God for our own failings, rather than owning up to our mistakes and actions. Recognizing our own role in the issues we face is in line with reciprocity, as we should be held accountable for our own actions in the same way we hold others accountable for theirs. It encourages us to stop attributing our own errors and their consequences to God. Instead of blaming God for our problems, we should be open to God's wisdom and guidance and strive to rectify our errors."

  },
  {
    "question": "How does the author illustrate the Law of Reciprocity with his experience in the forest?",
    "answer": "The author illustrates the Law of Reciprocity with his experience in the forest by showing how his actions had consequences. He was working under the hot sun and became very thirsty, but he had not brought any water with him. When he finally found a stream, he drank from it without considering the source.

  },
  {
    "question": "How does the author apply the Law of Reciprocity to business practices?",
    "answer": "The author applies the Law of Reciprocity to business practices by emphasizing the importance of customer service. He suggests that businesses that serve their customers well will receive loyalty and repeat business in return. Conversely, businesses that cheat or mistreat their customers may lose them forever.

  {
    "question": "How does the author suggest we should handle mistakes or problems?",

    "answer": "The author uses the story of the Love Canal to illustrate the Law of Reciprocity by showing the consequences of actions taken without considering their long-term effects. The Love Canal was initially intended to be a hydroelectric power source, but when that plan fell through, it was used as a chemical waste dump. Years later, the chemicals seeped into the ground and caused severe health problems for the residents who had built homes there. This story illustrates the Law of Reciprocity by showing that actions taken without considering their potential consequences can lead to harmful outcomes."

    "question": "What does the phrase \"To whom much is given, much will be required\" mean in the context of the Christian faith?",
    "answer": "This phrase, spoken by Jesus Christ, is a fundamental principle in the Christian faith. It means that the more resources, opportunities, and abilities God has given us, the more He expects us to use them for His glory and the advancement of His kingdom.

    "question": "What does the Bible say about retirement?",
    "answer": "The Bible doesn't specifically mention retirement in the way we understand it today. In biblical times, people continued to serve God and work until they passed away. The phrase \"rested with his ancestors\" is often used to describe the death of a person.

  },
  {
    "question": "How does author relate the Law of Responsibility to business and spiritual ministry?",
    "answer": "The author explains this law by using examples from the business world and spiritual ministry. For instance, a small business would be commended for a $10,000 profit, but a large bank, existing with vastly more resources, would be seen as a failure if they achieved the same amount. Similarly, a small church leading a hundred people to faith would be a success, but a large broadcast network like CBN, which has a wider reach, would be seen as failing if they achieved the same result. It illustrates the law in a pragmatic way- the more has been given, the more is expected."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does this Law of Responsibility keep pride in check, according to the author?",
    "answer": "The author suggests that the Law of Responsibility keeps pride in check since it constantly demands us to bring forth a return commensurate with the opportunities and resources we have been given.

    "answer": "When the Bible says that certain kings \"rested with their ancestors,\" it typically indicates their death. The author uses this phrase to illustrate the biblical view of life and work. Unlike the modern concept of retirement, the Bible presents a continuous pursuit of serving God and working until the end of earthly life, after which people \"rested with their ancestors.\""
  },
  {
    "question": "Why does the author say the idea of \"taking it easy\" in heaven is ridiculous?",
    "answer": "The author finds the notion of \"taking it easy\" in heaven as ridiculous because the idea of idleness contradicts the biblical view of eternal life. According to the Bible, even in heaven, everyone has a purpose and responsibilities. The Apostle Paul even mentions that the saints will judge angels, implying a dynamic, meaningful existence. This view is in stark contrast to the popular image of eternal rest and idleness in heaven."
  },
  {
    "question": "How did the Law of Responsibility impact the growth of The Christian Broadcasting Network?",
    "answer": "The Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) is an example of the Law of Responsibility in action. The author, starting with modest resources—an old car, $70, a few basic household items—used what was available to him, and CBN began to grow. Over the next twenty years, their annual income grew to $50 million, and they have reportedly helped over a hundred million people worldwide come to faith. This shows that as more resources were entrusted to them, they took on the responsibility to create a more significant impact."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the author connect the Law of Responsibility to our eternal life, according to the Bible?",
    "answer": "In the Bible, the Apostle Paul says that the saints will judge the angels, indicating a sense of duty or responsibility in the life to come. According to Astrophysicist Dr. Hugh Ross, there are incredibly vast numbers of stars (and presumably planets) in the universe, implying the potential for massive responsibility as God may assign each of His saints a planet to manage for eternity. The author uses this to emphasize the enduring nature of the Law of Responsibility, extending even into eternity."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the author's view on retirement based on biblical principles?",
    "answer": "The author believes that, in biblical terms, there is no concept of retirement as it is understood today. Instead, individuals served God and worked throughout their lives. They rested only upon joining their ancestors in death. The author implies that life is lived fully when continuously active in service to God and others, reflecting the Law of Responsibility."
  },
  {
    "question": "How has the author's own life experience reflected the Law of Responsibility?",
    "answer": "The author's life reflects the Law of Responsibility through his journey with The Christian Broadcasting Network. He began with very little-$70 and a used car. With those resources, he launched his ministry and continued to grow it. As more was entrusted to him-over time his annual income grew to $50 million-he expanded his outreach, resulting in millions coming to faith around the world. This showcases how he used everything given to him, bringing forth a return proportional to the opportunities and resources placed in his hands."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the Law of Responsibility relate to the parable of talents in the Bible?",
    "answer": "The Law of Responsibility relates closely to the Parable of the Talents (Matthew 25:14-30) where a Master entrusts varying amounts of talents (a unit of money) to his three servants and then goes on a journey. Upon his return, he finds that two servants have doubled their talents, but one has buried his and has no more than what was given. The master praises the productive servants for their faithfulness with a few things and entrusts them with many things. Thus, like the Law of Responsibility, the parable underscores the mandate of using our given resources effectively to produce more, otherwise, we may face dire consequences."

All three of these men achieved what many consider worldly greatness, but the text questions whether this truly makes them great in the grand scheme of life and according to biblical principles."
  },
  {
    "question": "What example did Jesus give of being a servant?",
    "answer": "Jesus demonstrated being a servant by washing His disciples’ feet during the Passover meal, a task typically performed by a slave.

  {
    "question": "Why is the phrase \"if it be thy will\" considered a faith killer when praying for miracles?",

On one hand, the fig tree can be seen as a representation of Israel, seemingly promising salvation through its magnificent ceremonies and priesthood but offering no real spiritual nourishment or substance.

Jesus using His words to wither the fig tree is an example of the kind of authority and results we can expect when we combine faith and the right declaration."
  },
  {
    "question": "According to the chapter, what are the two types of faith described in the Bible?",

  },
  {
    "question": "From the example of Abraham, what can we learn about having faith in God?",
    "answer": "From the example of Abraham, we learn that having faith in God means being fully convinced in God's ability to fulfill His promises.

  },
  {
    "question": "Why is forgiveness necessary for miracles to occur?",
    "answer": "Forgiveness is necessary for miracles to occur because an unforgiving heart creates a barrier between us and God, and hinders His work in our lives.

    "answer": "In the context of \"The Law of Miracles\", a miracle is defined as a supernatural occurrence or result that comes about through faith in God and the declarative power of His word. It is faith in action, fully persuaded that God is able to perform what He has promised."
  },
  {
    "question": "According to the text, what is the role of 'declaration' in receiving a miracle?",
